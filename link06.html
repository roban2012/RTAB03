This week’s summit in Beijing helped, but great-power rivalry still threatens the Pacific	<br><br>

IN CHINA even a handshake is an expression of power. When Xi Jinping met Barack Obama in Beijing this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit, Mr Xi stood on the right, his body open towards the cameras in an attitude of confident strength. The visitor was required to approach him, as if paying tribute, from the left, shoulder defensively towards the photographers. These days, from the smallest details of summit choreography to the biggest global issues, the rivalry between China and America trumps everything.	<br><br>
On the face if it, diplomacy triumphed this week. There was an even more momentous handshake―the long-awaited, reluctant one between Mr Xi and Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, which signalled a lowering of tensions over disputed islands. Mr Xi and the president of the Philippines, Benigno Aquino, had a “meeting of minds” over a separate maritime matter. China and South Korea agreed a trade deal of their own. And America and China made real progress on climate change, visas, trade and security. Compared with the torpor and occasional ill-temper of previous APEC summits, this was visionary stuff (see article), and the summitry is now moving on to Myanmar and Australia. The trouble is that all this is only a first step in diffusing the tensions in the Pacific created by the rise of China and America’s relative decline.	<br><br>

I’m sailing right behind―in a gunboat	<br><br>
Ever since the second world war, America’s naval might has guaranteed Asia’s security. Richard Nixon’s visit to Beijing in 1972 was celebrated because it aligned America and China against Soviet Russia. But it also signalled China’s willingness to help America end the Vietnam war, and thus to tolerate an Asian pax Americana. Those days are now at an end.	<br><br>
China’s economy will soon overtake America’s to become the world’s largest. China is once again in league with Russia―on November 9th the two signed another huge gas deal. In a head-on war China’s armed forces would be no match for America’s. But their growing strength will increasingly keep America at arm’s length, prevent it from protecting Taiwan and pose a threat to its bases in South Korea and Japan. Mr Xi could not have been clearer when he declared, earlier this year, “It is for the people of Asia to…uphold the security of Asia.”	<br><br>
China’s growth is not the only reason for change. As our special report in this issue sets out, the Pacific rim as a whole has become too prosperous and too complex for the ocean to be either America’s lake or China’s. The Asian middle class has increased sevenfold since 2000. In Latin America, by contrast, it has merely doubled. Asian countries, including South Korea, have become influential actors in world trade. America is their chief ally and China their largest trading partner. They do not want to be satellites of either.	<br><br>
Unfortunately, pax Americana is giving way to a balance of power that is seething with rivalry and insecurity. Everywhere China sees American plots designed to prevent its rise. American alliances contain it, foreign-funded NGOs undermine the Communist Party, and spies foment protests in Hong Kong and among the Uighurs in Xinjiang. In August a Chinese fighter-jet and an American surveillance plane passed within 20 feet, just avoiding a mid-air collision. Perhaps because Mr Xi and Mr Obama understand that this could have plunged the two superpowers into crisis they pledged this week to improve military communications. Smaller countries, for their part, are alarmed by Chinese bullying―especially over disputed claims to rocks, shoals, reefs and sandbanks around China’s coastline. Chinese high-handedness drove Myanmar towards the West and provoked anti-China riots in Vietnam this year. Asia is arming itself. In the five years to 2013 it accounted for 47% of global weapons imports, up from 40% in 2004-08.	<br><br>
America, naturally, wants to maintain the status quo. Mr Obama, who grew up in Hawaii, stressed this week that his is a “thoroughly Pacific nation”. But American diplomacy is at best distracted and at worst divisive. Rhetoric about “pivoting” and “rebalancing” towards Asia was meant to reassure America’s allies; instead it fed Chinese paranoia. China appreciates Western-inspired rules in commerce. But America’s ambivalence over whether China will one day be welcome to join its grand trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), has allowed even that to become a source of tension. As China grows, it deserves a bigger role in international institutions, yet Congress has blocked reforms to give China more clout in the IMF.	<br><br>
All this has encouraged China to set up its own clubs―its own trade deal, its own development bank and its own regional-security grouping. The bank may be useful, but this approach will not serve China well. Global institutions such as the world trading and financial systems, freedom of navigation and international action on climate change are vital for the country’s prosperity. China weakens them at its peril.	<br><br>
All your dreams are on their way	<br><br>
Rather than entrench rivalries by creating two parallel systems, the Pacific powers should focus on adapting today’s institutions. Trade could become the exemplar. TPP should be a symbol of America’s commitment to the Pacific; with more effort, Mr Obama could sell it to both a pro-business Republican Congress and a foot-dragging Japan. By making vigorous efforts to get China to join, America could signal that it wants to build an inclusive world order. More than that, TPP could show the nationalists in Beijing that a rules-based international system will benefit China more than great-power jockeying. Asia needs such institutions in almost every sphere.	<br><br>
Nineteenth-century Europe discovered how difficult it is to use the balance of power to keep the peace. For decades it laboured to absorb the rise of Wilhelmine Germany and Imperial Russia, and the decline of Austria-Hungary, before succumbing to war in 1914 in a fit of nationalistic fervour. A lot of blood had to be spilled before the Atlantic countries understood that institutions―NATO, the UN and even the unloved European Union―are needed to shore up international relations. Let us hope that the Pacific, cradle of so many of the world’s hopes, can reach that understanding by peaceful means.	<br><br>

<a href= "pic04.html">Trade: Pacific VS. Atlantic</a><br><br>

The Pacific Age	<br><br>
Under American leadership the Pacific has become the engine room of world trade. But the balance of power is shifting, writes Henry Tricks	<br><br>
 Nov 15th 2014 	<br><br>
WILLIAM HENRY SEWARD was no misty-eyed dreamer. It was whaling, or what he eulogised as “the chase of the whale over his broad range of the universal ocean”, that first drew his attention to the Pacific. He was a visionary, though. The man who became Abraham Lincoln’s secretary of state in 1861 and bought Alaska from tsarist Russia in 1867 knew what America had to do to take advantage of the opening of the Pacific. It needed to build on the Gold Rush spirit in California; finish a transcontinental railway to carry people and freight from one side of America to the other; dig a waterway through Central America for ships to pass through; and acquire Pacific territories like Hawaii and Midway as maritime hubs of trade and security. All this was done either within his lifetime or within a few decades of it.	<br><br>
He was also itching to wield America’s nascent power and saw the Pacific as the place to do it. In a speech to Congress in 1852 he predicted that the Europe-centred Atlantic would decline in importance “while the Pacific Ocean, its shores, its islands and the vast regions beyond, will become the chief theatre of events in the world’s great hereafter”. Commerce, he added, would be the “great agent of this movement” and would flourish between America and China.	<br><br>
The Pacific evokes that kind of enthusiasm. It is a 64m square mile (165m square km) blank on the map (except for a plethora of small islands), bigger than the world’s entire landmass. Still, at times it seemed as though its destiny would never arrive. The refrain, “The Mediterranean is the ocean of the past, the Atlantic is the ocean of the present and the Pacific is the ocean of the future,” first heard more than 100 years ago, is still repeated today. Yet exactly half a century after Japan “rejoined the world” (in the phrase of Ian Buruma, a writer) by hosting the Olympics in 1964, the Pacific Age has now clearly arrived. Japan’s economic power may have peaked 25 years ago, but it produced a trans-Pacific competition that now has America and China vying with each other for the title of the world’s largest economy (at purchasing-power parity). All three Pacific nations trade vigorously with one another.	<br><br>
At the same time trade has surged into the farthest reaches of the Pacific (see charts). Since the 1970s trade across the Pacific has far outrun the Atlantic sort. China, for instance, has taken its hunger for high-protein food and raw materials to Latin America and become the biggest trading partner of distant Chile. By one estimate, in 2010 it promised more 	<br><br>
loans to Latin America than the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the United States Export-Import Bank combined.	<br><br>
Such connections have made the developing rim of the Pacific a growth factory. Whereas the United States’ economy grew by an average of 1.6% a year over the past decade and the European Union’s by 1.7%, Latin America’s expanded by 4.6%, East Asia by 5.4% and South-East Asia by 5.9%. The 21 economies of the largest trans-Pacific grouping, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), account for nearly half of global trade. This special report will refer to them as “the Pacific”, though they exclude the tropical Oceanian economies. “The region comprises not only the world’s ‘factory floor’ but also its most important sources of services, technology and investment, and final-goods markets,” writes Peter Petri, an international-trade economist.	<br><br>
It has also seen an astounding increase in prosperity. In poorer parts of Asia the size of the middle classes―those living on $2-$20 a day―has increased sevenfold since the turn of the millennium. In Latin America it has doubled. Parts of Malaysia have become so bourgeois that taxi drivers moonlight as salesmen of smart apartments overlooking the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest trade routes.	<br><br>
Both America and China know how important it is to keep this economic engine running, so in public they generally use moderate language about each other. In 2011 Hillary Clinton, then America’s secretary of state, explained President Barack Obama’s “pivot” to Asia in an article in Foreign Policy: “We all know that fears and misconceptions linger on both sides of the Pacific. Some in our country see China’s progress as a threat to the United States; some in China worry that America seeks to constrain China’s growth. We reject both those views.” China’s president, Xi Jinping, at a meeting with Mr Obama in California last year, responded in kind: “The vast Pacific Ocean has enough space for the two large countries of China and the United States.”	<br><br>

<a href= "pic03.html">Pacific Trade</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic04.html">Trade: Pacific VS. Atlantic</a><br><br>

Choppy waters	<br><br>
Yet just when the Pacific Age should be celebrating its half-century, the region is showing signs of strain, from increased rivalry between the superpowers and emerging nationalism in Japan, China and elsewhere to sudden squalls in places like Hong Kong, Thailand and, as ever, North Korea. “The shifting landscape in the Asia-Pacific and associated risks are about as challenging as they’ve been since APEC was established in 1989,” says Alan Bollard, the organisation’s executive director.	<br><br>
There are complex counter-currents. Many East Asian countries worry that America’s commitment to the region could be put at risk by more immediate threats in the Middle East and Ukraine. At the same time they do not want America to provoke China by becoming too involved. The rhetoric has recently been turned up. Chuck Hagel, America’s defence secretary, wagged a finger at China when he told a gathering of military chiefs at the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore in May: “One of the most critical tests facing the region is whether nations will choose to resolve disputes through diplomacy and well-established international rules and norms or through intimidation and coercion. Nowhere is this more evident than in the South China Sea.” In his own speech a day later, Lieutenant-General Wang Guanzhong, head of the Chinese delegation, retorted: “Assertiveness has come from the joint actions of the United States and Japan, not China.”	<br><br>
Recently the tensions have spread to the economic sphere, too. China has interrupted investment and trade with neighbours who stand up to its territorial assertiveness, such as Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam. China and America each have their own plans for turning the Pacific into a giant free-trade area that both see as a test of their influence in the region―and in the wider world. The Obama administration says it wants to forge a trade pact with the world’s most sophisticated rules in the Pacific: the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It characterises China as wanting to perpetuate a model of state capitalism.	<br><br>
Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington describes the overlapping commercial and strategic concerns as a juggling tournament. “We’re in the middle of an historic transformation of the economic architecture of the whole Pacific region. There are competing models and high politics. It’s a very complex set of balls in the air,” he says.	<br><br>
Pacific history―an underdeveloped field of study compared with that of the Atlantic, as its scholars dolefully note―is awash with big-power rivalries (see next article). For centuries European powers were carving it into monopolistic trading enclaves that they defended ruthlessly. The only free-traders were pirates. The risks of history repeating itself are palpable.	<br><br>
Many argue that the ocean’s most vulnerable spot is its lack of robust institutions to ensure fair play. They point to the Atlantic Charter, forged in 1941 in the heat of war by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt, that laid down rules to prevent territorial aggression, reduce trade restrictions and ensure freedom of the seas. All of these are live issues in the western Pacific today.	<br><br>
Mr Bergsten says the “obvious cultural affinities” across the Atlantic that produced the charter, and institutions such as NATO, are “of a different order” from those across the Pacific, or even within East Asia. “Having a beach on the Pacific does not make you a member of a community,” snorts Robert Manning of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think-tank. Some say that the only shared ideology in East Asia is nationalism and a sense of historical grievance against each other.	<br><br>

<a href= "pic03.html">Pacific Trade</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic04.html">Trade: Pacific VS. Atlantic</a><br><br>

Four reasons for optimism	<br><br>
Yet this special report will argue that even when values clash, shared interests in the region tend to prevail. East Asia, like America, is a place where power is judged first and foremost by wealth. “In East Asia, with the exception of North Korea, growth far more than any abstract political theory is the primary means by which governments legitimate their rule,” says Bilahari Kausikan, Singapore’s ambassador-at-large. “This does not guarantee peace. But East Asian governments at least have a strong self-interest to minimise actions that would disrupt growth.”	<br><br>
Besides growth, the promise of the Pacific rests on three other fairly sturdy legs: trade, ideas and connectivity. Trade is part of the Pacific’s DNA. While values and ideals travelled across the Atlantic with the Pilgrim Fathers, goods were flowing across the Pacific: silver, silk, porcelain, spices, sandalwood, much of it beautifully crafted in China. Today much of the traffic is in silicon.	<br><br>
Trade moves with the times. Japan’s elegant “flying geese” model (with Japan leading industrialisation in Asia and the rest following in V-formation) brought manufacturing to the “miracle” economies of South-East Asia in the 1990s and even survived the abrupt intrusion of the Chinese dragon in the 2000s. But no one can glide complacently. America is becoming more competitive, thanks to fracking, its energy revolution of the past half-decade; so some Asian economies are likely to become more closely connected to and more dependent on it.	<br><br>
With trade come ideas. Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean writer, puts free-market economics at the head of a list of “seven pillars of wisdom” that Asia has imported from the West, along with science and technology, meritocracy, pragmatism, peace, rule of law and education. At the same time Pacific Latin American countries are looking to East Asia for economic models.	<br><br>
Even China’s “state capitalism” may be exaggerated. In a new book, “Markets over Mao”, Nicholas Lardy, an American economist, crunches the numbers to argue that the secret of China’s success is private business, not the state-owned giants. Private firms have become “the major source of economic growth, the sole source of job creation and the major contributor to China’s still-growing role as a global trader”, he writes.	<br><br>
Smaller countries around the Pacific, such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), band together for strength in numbers against the big powers. There is a constant flow of people, across the Pacific to Silicon Valley and back again; and there are pop-culture excursions between three countries, China, Japan and South Korea, that are otherwise staunchly nationalist. The Pacific is where the 21st century’s habit of networking is most advanced. From Silicon Valley to Shanghai, the world’s biggest internet firms have flourished. Nirvikar Singh, co-editor of “The Oxford Handbook of the Economics of the Pacific Rim”, published earlier this year, says the ocean is becoming the world’s “digital playground”.	<br><br>
To be a playground rather than a battleground, however, it needs rules that govern trade and the sea routes across which commerce flows. Since the second world war these rules have been underpinned by an American security presence that has helped keep the peace in the Pacific―give or take self-inflicted wounds, such as the Vietnam war. Yet America is not the only arbiter. APEC’s Mr Bollard says the region has benefited from a set of “loose-tight” standards of behaviour―guidelines rather than hard-and-fast rules―that have helped the region muddle through Vietnam, the spread of communism, China’s cultural revolution and other periods of severe instability. A rising China, too, wants a say in setting the rules, especially in its own neighbourhood. Getting all sides to agree on what those rules should be is the challenge for the next half-century of the Pacific Age.	<br><br>

Galleons and gunships	<br><br>
Pacific history has been defined by bullies enforcing their rules	<br><br>
 Nov 15th 2014   	<br><br>
 THE RUINS OF St Paul’s church on a hill in the Malaysian city of Malacca provide a good view of the vicissitudes of Pacific trade. Peer through the late-monsoon haze from its cobbled courtyard, and you can just about see container ships and oil tankers chugging through the blue-green waters of the Strait of Malacca. At least 70,000 ships pass on their way to and from the Pacific and Indian oceans each year, carrying a third of the world’s seaborne oil and many of its goods.	<br><br>
From its beginning, Malacca has been an entrepot between the Pacific and the rest of the world. Shortly after the city was founded in 1400, a Chinese Muslim from the Ming court, the eunuch Zheng He, used it as a base for his “treasure ships”. Hundreds of vessels bore 20,000 crewmen, passengers and horses through the western Pacific to take silk, porcelain and tea to countries as far away as east Africa.	<br><br>
But after 1433 China abruptly stopped trading missions to the outside world, and a much uglier form of trade emerged. This was the European version, laden with mercantilist and imperialist ambitions partly disguised as a mission to spread Christianity. St Paul’s, originally called Our Lady of the Hill, was built by the Portuguese after they blitzed Malacca in 1511, driving out the sultan. It was a staging post for undermining Venice’s monopoly over the trading of Asian spices through the Mediterranean. Portugal wanted its own monopoly, and got it.	<br><br>
One of the Portuguese victors at Malacca was Ferdinand Magellan. With an eye on establishing a rival trading route to the Spice Islands, he later defected to Spain, found a passage around Cape Horn and baptised the Pacific Ocean. His Spanish successors, sailing from Acapulco with galleons full of silver, used the Philippines (named after their king, Philip II) as a hub for trade with China between 1565 and 1815. The Pacific became a Spanish lake, defended by cannon from all manner of pirates.	<br><br>
In 1641 it was the turn of the Dutch to blast the Portuguese out of Malacca. They turned the church into a Protestant one and changed its name to St Paul’s. A nearby fort is engraved with the letters VOC, after the Dutch East India Company. The vast firm built its own monopoly in the Spice Islands. All clove and nutmeg trees apart from those belonging to the VOC were uprooted, and anyone unconnected to the company caught growing or selling cloves was executed.	<br><br>
In 1819 the British claimed Malacca from the Dutch, ran up a big Union Jack at St Paul’s, used the church as an ammunition dump and put a lighthouse in front. In the second world war Malacca was briefly overrun by the Japanese, but recently it has returned to the tranquillity of its birth.	<br><br>
When your correspondent visited, a muezzin’s call to Friday prayers floated up from a nearby mosque. Islam, too, first came to South-East Asia on Arab trading dhows. Its influence has been much more enduring than that of Christianity.	<br><br>

布热津斯基：太平洋宪章――大棋局的嬗变	<br><br>
国际关系学者，曾任卡特政府的国家安全顾问	<br><br>
2014/11/13	<br><br>
【10日上午，来访的美国总统奥巴马在北京将中国称作“维护国际秩序的伙伴”，呼吁中国不要“破坏”国际秩序。美国著名战略学者、前总统卡特的国家安全顾问兹比格涅夫 布热津斯基大力为奥巴马的主张背书，认为中美应进一步正式签署“太平洋宪章”。他认为中美两国虽在民主人权等价值观方面存在差异，但双方都已认识到彼此唇齿相依，为全球稳定而加强合作是共同事业。此外，在布热津斯基看来，类似中东这样的地区，美国自身深陷泥潭，由于殖民历史英法又难有作为，而没有政治包袱的中国的各类利益已经覆盖中东，维护这一地区的稳定局势与中国息息相关。美国互联网大报《赫芬顿邮报》旗下的《世界邮报》采访了布热津斯基，观察者网特此全文翻译，以飨读者。】	<br><br>
《世界邮报》：不久前，你提出美国应面向中国“全新开放”，并提出中美应签署“太平洋宪章”。你是基于怎样的战略推理得出这个结论的？	<br><br>
布热津斯基：全球秩序混乱的趋势越来越明显，这就决定了美国越来越难以单凭自己去应付雨后春笋般出现的混乱局面。	<br><br>
今天，我们看到俄罗斯在欧洲独断专行――它吞并克里米亚，并试图动摇乌克兰的稳定，重新开启了通过武力实现领土变更的封印――这是希特勒死后欧洲首次面对这样的问题。另外，激进主义在中东地区爆炸式扩张，它已经传播到了巴基斯坦和阿富汗，并可能进一步向东北方向的中国传播。	<br><br>
今天的中国是一个大国，在经济上已与美国平起平坐，它还是一个军事强国。和美国一样，国际秩序的稳定也与中国利害攸关。如果无法保证稳定，中国经济发展这个首要任务便会遭遇风险。	<br><br>
因此，防止世界形势朝暴力和混乱进一步堕落，是符合中美两国共同利益的。	<br><br>
《世界邮报》：你的意思是否是中美应该结盟？	<br><br>
布热津斯基：我说的既不是结盟，也不是搞一些戏剧性的联合行动。我的意思是，全世界最重要的两个国家，应当以负责任的方式处理对两国利益构成威胁的事务。中美合作将向世界证明，大国不光为自身谋取利益，也会为了全球稳定而合作。	<br><br>
今天，我们需要中美关系更进一步，这种关系不应局限于维护双方具体的国家利益，而应专注于维护世界稳定，防止当前的各种矛盾进一步失控，最后发展到无可救药的地步。中美应保障全球局势不至于滑向混乱，消除世界公众的疑惧。	<br><br>
1941年，美英两国首脑签署了《大西洋宪章》。在那个历史时刻，正是它产生了这样的影响。	<br><br>
《世界邮报》：但是，民主和人权是英国和美国共有的价值观。中国和美国政治制度差异如此巨大，真能建立起这种伙伴关系吗？	<br><br>
布热津斯基：“宪章”这个概念，表示这是一件严肃的事业，而不是一串口号。是的，中美两国的确差异巨大，但更重要的是，双方都已认识到彼此唇齿相依。这在一定程度上将促使两国加强合作。	<br><br>
比如，在我看来，中国可以在维护中东地区稳定上发挥独特的作用。由于该地的殖民历史，法国和英国难有作为。美国在伊拉克先发制人地发动攻击，造成当地势力四分五裂，严重削弱了美国的力量。中国的经济、能源利益已经覆盖中东地区，而又没有什么政治包袱。这样看来，维护和巩固当地的稳定局势似乎与中国的利益息息相关。	<br><br>
《世界邮报》：从历史上看，中国一直是中央王国，以朝贡体系维持对周边地区的支配。从未曾扮演过全球性角色的中国，能否接受挑战与美国一起扮演这样的角色？	<br><br>
布热津斯基：中国自身的利益已遍布全球各地，这使得它必须接受这一挑战。美国和中国对彼此来说如此重要：合作更紧密，两国都会受益；任由全球秩序崩坏，两国都将受损。	<br><br>
中国已认识到，现今的世界已不再有唯一的霸主来承担维护稳定的责任。现在，我们需要对稳定做出共同的承诺。最大、最有影响力的两个大国共同为包括欧洲、日本、印度、东盟和拉丁美洲在内的全世界建立秩序的基础，才是合乎情理的。	<br><br>
所有国家都能在全球新秩序中发挥建设性作用。这个趋势已渐趋明朗，就连日本和中国也明白了，相互维护稳定、避免腐蚀性冲突符合两国更宏大的利益。	<br><br>
如果俄罗斯也能成为合作伙伴，一起塑造稳定的世界秩序，那自然最好。但现在看来，他们似已决心走狂热的民族主义道路。	<br><br>
《世界邮报》：落实上述建议的期限是多久？	<br><br>
布热津斯基：时不我待。过去我们总是空泛地说中美应在遥远的未来达成合作，现在是时候抛弃这种陈词滥调了。如果世界两大国无法加速推进事物发展，我们都会倒霉。	<br><br>

In Beijing on Monday, U.S. President Barack Obama called on China to be a "partner in underwriting the international order" instead of "undermining" it. One key American strategist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to U.S. President Jimmy Carter, is strongly promoting the idea that Obama's notion should be pushed further and formalized into a "Pacific Charter."	<br><br>
In this interview, I asked Brzezinski to flesh out his idea:	<br><br>
WorldPost: You have recently proposed a "new opening" to China and a "Pacific Charter" between the U.S. and China. What is the strategic reasoning behind this proposal at this time?	<br><br>
Zbigniew Brzezinski: It is dictated by global trends that point to more and more disorder across the world. It is increasingly difficult for the United States on its own to deal with this burgeoning chaos.	<br><br>
We are seeing today Russia's self-assertion in Europe. By annexing the Crimea and seeking to destabilize the Ukraine, it has opened up once again the issue of territorial changes accomplished by force of arms -- something that has not taken place in Europe since Hitler. The Middle East is exploding with radicalization. That can spread as it already has to Pakistan and Afghanistan and further northeast -- toward China	<br><br>
China today is a major power, co-equal economically with the United States. It is militarily significant. And it has a major stake, just as the U.S. does, in international stability. Without stability, China's top priority -- its economic development -- will be very much at risk.	<br><br>
So both countries have a stake in preventing the world situation from degenerating into violence and instability.	<br><br>
WorldPost: Are you suggesting an alliance?	<br><br>
Brzezinski: I am not talking about an alliance, or some dramatic joint action. I am talking about the two most important countries in the world addressing in a responsible fashion the issues that threaten both of our interests. Together that can give the world a sense of the big powers working together not only for their own well-being but for the sake of global stability.	<br><br>
What is needed today is the enhancement of the U.S.-China relationship that is not focused on the specific national interests of each, but on the larger agenda of stabilizing the world before the present conflicts spin so far out of control they can't be contained. The world public needs some reassurance that we are not drifting into global chaos.	<br><br>
At a different historical moment, in 1941, that was the impact of the Atlantic Charter between the U.S. and Great Britain.	<br><br>
WorldPost: But Britain and the U.S. shared the same values of democracy and human rights.	<br><br>
Are China and America capable of that kind of partnership with such differing political systems?	<br><br>
Brzezinski: The idea of a "charter" is to indicate that this is a serious undertaking and not a set of slogans. Yes, the differences are great between the U.S. and China. But what is remarkable is that both realize that our degree of interdependence is such that if one suffers so does the other. That is a very powerful inducement for some degree of enhanced cooperation.	<br><br>
It would seem to me that China could play a unique role in stabilizing the Middle East, for example. The role of France and Great Britain has been damaged there by its history of colonialism. The U.S. has been severely weakened by the pre-emptive attack in Iraq and the consequent disintegration there. China, which has serious economic and energy interests in the Middle East but no political baggage, would seem to me to have a great stake in playing a role that reinforces stability there.	<br><br>
WorldPost: Historically, China has been the Middle Kingdom that dominated only its region through a system of tributaries. It has never had a global role. Is it up to the challenge of joining with the U.S. in such a role?	<br><br>
Brzezinski: China is obliged by its own interests -- that now span the globe because of its large economic presence -- to rise to this challenge. The fact that the U.S. and China are so important to each other makes a strong case for the proposition that we would both benefit from closer cooperation because we will both be hurt by the continuing spread of global disorder.	<br><br>
China recognizes the reality that there is not longer a single hegemon in the world upon which the responsibility of stability rests. Now we need a shared commitment to achieve that stability. It only makes sense that the two largest and most influential powers establish the foundation of order in which others -- Europe, Japan, India, the ASEAN nations, Latin America -- are, of course, included.	<br><br>
All can play a constructive role here, as is becoming clear as even Japan and China realize they have a greater interest in mutual stability instead of corrosive conflict.	<br><br>
It would be nice if the Russians could also be partners in shaping a new stability. But right now they seem bent on a form of national fanaticism.	<br><br>
WorldPost: What is the time frame of your thinking?	<br><br>
Brzezinski: The time is now. It is time to get past the usual empty bromides about some kind of cooperation in the distant future. If the world's two top powers cannot manage to get a handle on unfolding events sooner rather than later, we all will suffer.	<br><br>
