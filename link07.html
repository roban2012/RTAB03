	奥巴马的外交决策小圈子

“下一代”的小圈子为奥巴马带来舒适度的同时，也招致了“业余”的诟病，甚至有观点将其视为美国外交决策圈资质降低的首要指标。	<br><br>
作者：刁大明 中国社科院美国研究所助理研究员 来源：南风窗 日期：2014-10-13 浏览：239 　“东南亚国家不必在大国之间选择一方，特别是在美国和中国之间。”被视为奥巴马心腹和首席外交顾问的苏珊 赖斯，9月22日在华盛顿意有所指地称，中国的崛起和美国亚太再平衡应该成为本地区加大合作的机遇。此前，赖斯为奥巴马11月“重要里程碑”式访华行程而探路，分别在北京人民大会堂和八一大楼受到习近平、范长龙的友好接见。	<br><br>
 赖斯来华前后，另两位美国对外政策“操盘手”也在海外奔波：国务卿约翰 克里9月10日飞抵巴格达，而防长查克 哈格尔则在格鲁吉亚向俄罗斯隔空喊话。但与克里、哈格尔所扮演的执行角色不同，赖斯主要负责对外政策制定，甚至有研究称“奥巴马对华政策皆出自赖斯团队”。	<br><br>
 事实上，自第二任期以来，奥巴马外交决策的“内核小圈子”色彩浓厚。真正的决策者并非拜登、克里等人，而是那些围绕在奥巴马身边的党羽，其中以苏珊 赖斯、萨曼莎 鲍尔、丹尼斯 麦克多诺、马克 利珀特以及本 罗兹等人最为核心。	<br><br>
 亲历卢旺达的姐妹花	<br><br>
 “如果再面对那样的危机，我一定会做点什么，即便赴汤蹈火。”多年后，苏珊 赖斯（Susan Rice）还时常回忆起1994年在卢旺达亲历的种族灭绝惨剧。这位牛津大学国际关系学博士当时身为克林顿政府国安会分管非洲事务的助理，不到30岁的她时常难以招架残酷的政治现实。3年之后，赖斯母亲的密友马德琳 奥尔布赖特执掌美国国务院，并很快安排赖斯出任分管非洲事务的助理国务卿。其后赖斯直接处理了基地组织炸毁美驻肯尼亚和坦桑尼亚使馆等重大事件，积累了外交经验。	<br><br>
 与苏珊 赖斯调入国务院同年，萨曼莎 鲍尔（Samantha Power）告别了新闻界，进入哈佛大学攻读法律。其时的鲍尔只有27岁，但已为《美国新闻与世界报道》、《经济学人》等媒体工作4年，足迹遍布卢旺达、东帝汶、苏丹、科索沃、波黑等地。而几乎也是1994年关于卢旺达的报道，令鲍尔心有余悸。	<br><br>
 2001年共和党人小布什入主白宫，苏珊 赖斯走过旋转门、到布鲁金斯学会从事研究。这位曾被非洲裔国会领袖认为“主张同化的华府非裔精英”却日益展现出比传统民主党人更为极端的自由派倾向：她当然反对小布什的战争，但理由是战争这个概念从根本上就错了。	<br><br>
 赖斯在布鲁金斯供职的第二年，读到了一本令其眼前一亮的书，书名叫《来自地狱的难题：美国与种族灭绝的时代》，这正是已获得法学博士学位的鲍尔的第二本书。在书中，对克林顿政府在波黑和卢旺达事务上决策迟缓持极大怀疑的鲍尔，阐释了自己的人道主义干预理念，即所谓的“自由干预主义”，这与赖斯不谋而合。不过，相比之下，鲍尔更实际些，她虽也强烈反对反恐战争，但理由是这种单边行动毫无合法性，且无视国际社会推进伊拉克人权状况的努力。	<br><br>
《来自地狱的难题》不仅为鲍尔带来普利策奖	<br><br>
 《来自地狱的难题》不仅为鲍尔带来普利策奖，还令其获得奥巴马青睐。2005年初，奥巴马当选国会参议员不久就拨通鲍尔的电话。很快，刚刚被《时代》评为全球百大影响力人物的鲍尔加入了当时还不那么出名的奥巴马团队。其后奥巴马关于达尔富尔问题的言论几乎全部出自鲍尔之手。	<br><br>
 2007年，总统大选隐形卡位战已硝烟弥漫，苏珊 赖斯放弃了希拉里 克林顿，转而支持气质相投的奥巴马。从辅选到执政，赖斯和鲍尔基本没有离开奥巴马外交团队，但因为被鲍尔称作“怪物”的希拉里的存在而无法尽情施展抱负。	<br><br>
 在奥巴马第二任期内，分别出任总统国家安全事务助理和驻联合国大使的两人显然成了奥巴马最为重要的谋臣。她们灌输给奥巴马的关于战争正当性的理念，成为美国外交政策的重要支柱。其具体内容，可参见奥巴马在接受诺贝尔和平奖时宣读的那篇出自鲍尔之笔的发言：“基于人道理由的武力是正当的……不采取行动不仅折磨我们的良心，还会导致未来以更高的代价进行干预。因此，所有负责任的国家都必须相信使命明确的军事行动所能发挥的维和作用。”	<br><br>
 不过，正是出于这种对战争的解释，赖斯和鲍尔作为最坚定的支持者劝说奥巴马做出了对利比亚动武的决定，但其后的班加西惨剧不仅断送了赖斯的国务卿梦，也令所谓的“奥巴马主义”深陷尴尬。	<br><br>
 国会背景的三人组	<br><br>
 在奥巴马入主白宫前，丹尼斯 麦克多诺（Denis McDonough）的名气仅局限在国会圈子里。这位拥有乔治城大学国际事务硕士学位的橄榄球悍将，在国会里工作了将近10年，先是担任众议院外交关系委员会主席李 汉密尔顿的拉美事务助理，后又出任参议院民主党领袖汤姆 达施勒的外交事务助理。这期间，他与达施勒的防务问题助理马克 利珀特（Mark Lippert）和汉密尔顿的发言撰稿人本 罗兹（Ben Rhodes）先后结识。	<br><br>
 利珀特比麦克多诺小4岁，获斯坦福大学国际关系硕士学位后进入国会工作，同时还加入了海军预备役。而罗兹又比利珀特小4岁，他从纽约大学拿到艺术硕士学位后，在布鲁克林大街上目击了“9 11”袭击全程，之后进入国会追随汉密尔顿，协助起草“9 11”事件特别调查委员会建议书和伊拉克调查小组报告，由此熟悉了中东事务。	<br><br>
 麦克多诺、利珀特和罗兹三人中，利珀特最先与奥巴马搭上关系。2004年，意外连任参议员失败的达施勒向新当选的奥巴马推荐了多位助手，其中就包括成为奥氏首位外交事务助理的利珀特。2006年初，奥巴马访问伊拉克时曾与利珀特共同住在萨达姆的一处旧居里，利珀特给奥巴马系统讲述了对于伊拉克政策的设想。当奥巴马问及美国在伊拉克该做什么时，利珀特的回答是“离开”。这些观点后来也就成了奥巴马不断重复的论点。	<br><br>
 奥巴马决定角逐白宫的2007年，利珀特招揽已在美国进步研究中心任职的麦克多诺加入外交事务团队，随后罗兹又被汉密尔顿推荐了过来，奥氏小圈子的“三驾马车”就此成型。其间，利珀特曾短暂应征赴伊拉克服役。奥巴马就任总统后，3人都被委以重任，不过利珀特因与奥巴马首任国家安全事务助理詹姆斯 琼斯不睦，不久就辞去了国安会办公室主任职务，转赴阿富汗服役，2012年才进入国防部。而麦克多诺先是接下利珀特遗缺，后改任国家安全事务副助理，2013年跃升为白宫办公厅主任。罗兹曾为奥巴马2009年的开罗演讲代笔，去年接下麦克多诺的国安副助理职位。有趣的是，在2011年定点清除本 拉丹行动中，麦克多诺负责华府协调，而利珀特则直接为海豹突击队提供情报分析，两人在前后方做了成功的间接配合。	<br><br>
 相较于赖斯和鲍尔的意识形态理想基调，麦、利、罗三人更为现实，强调国家的实际利益和目标的实现。利珀特曾这样回忆自己的服役经历：“在参议院工作时是为了战略，在伊拉克则是为了策略……我们（在国会）做了很多人权事务，但伊拉克的经历改变了我，我仍旧从那里积蓄力量。”而按照赖斯的说法，“利珀特与奥巴马一样，不是意识形态者，而是希望达成目的之人”。	<br><br>
 虽然在利比亚战争决策上，“三驾马车”输给了赖斯和鲍尔，但他们在中东事务上对奥巴马仍具有绝对的影响力。在埃及前总统穆巴拉克的去留问题上，他们推翻“法老”的看法显然压倒了希拉里。2014年9月10日，奥巴马所宣布的打击“伊斯兰国”的战略方案也基本上是由罗兹出面进一步解释的。	<br><br>
 尽管希拉里在新书《艰难抉择》中将美国的亚太再平衡更多归功于自己，但利珀特在北大短期留学的背景以及与奥巴马的密切关系也足以令其承担在亚太战略中的关键角色。利珀特已历任负责亚太事务的助理国防部长和国防部办公室主任，随着美国驻日、驻华大使相继更迭，有关他接替金成出任驻韩大使的传闻不绝于耳，也从侧面说明了这一点。	<br><br>
 奥巴马的小圈子	<br><br>
 无论理想还是现实，赖斯们组成的小圈子构成了奥巴马外交决策的关键环节。按照前防长罗伯特 盖茨的回忆，很多时候是在小圈子已拿出决策之后，奥巴马才会请希拉里、盖茨等人来讨论，甚至直接要求他们为决策背书，放弃异议、对外表态一致。	<br><br>
 自新政时期总统独立办事机构建立以来，特别是杜鲁门时代设置总统国家安全事务委员会之后，总统外交决策的小圈子也算是华府常态，但为什么盖茨还会如此抱怨呢？如果说盖茨的非议可以解释为党派偏见，那么希拉里的微词更一针见血：他们是“下一代人”。换言之，奥巴马的“小圈子”是老一代资深政客不入眼的小年轻们：他们认同、崇拜并追随奥巴马，又恰好具有一些专业积累，是这些而非丰富的经验成为进入小圈子的关键门槛。	<br><br>
 毫无外交经验和根基的奥巴马闯入华府至今，在对外决策团队中事实上划出了极为泾渭分明的年龄与资历界限。以2014年为计算点，53岁的奥巴马过去6年中的两位国务卿平均69岁、3位国防部长平均70.2岁，而所谓“小圈子”中的这5人则平均仅为43.4岁。这就是说，奥巴马将父辈留在行政职位上，利用这些人的资深证明决策的正当性与正确性，又将自己的“门客”们拢到身边，最彻底地贯彻自己的偏好。这种选择，几乎打破了以往总统政治中前朝老臣“回锅”的惯例，很大程度上反映出谋求改变的奥巴马自始至终对华府的不信任，他必须选择一些与历史、与传统割裂的人。	<br><br>
 “下一代”的小圈子为奥巴马带来舒适度的同时，也招致了“业余”的诟病，甚至有观点将其视为美国外交决策圈资质降低的首要指标。小圈子的成长年代基本与奥巴马相似，出生在越战中后期甚至越战之后，成长于冷战时代后期，90年代或新世纪头10年才正式进入职场，面对的最大问题是反恐战争和金融危机。这些背景至少导致了一些后果。其一，阅历与经验的有限，可能令他们更多倾向于理想主义的改变，一旦失败又会回落到现实的考量，导致政策的反复与不延续。其二，对越战印象的模糊和对中东事务的过度熟悉，导致他们对美国外交决策具有极度的失衡之感，会有动机谋求平衡，而金融危机与相对衰落显然加剧了他们对亚太地区的重视度。其三，恐怖威胁和反恐泥潭的主观痛苦印象令他们陷入决策的两难，他们更为了解中东局势的不可控性，并往往只做出一些试探性的渐进决策。其四，对冷战的零星记忆和对中美建交35年来起伏的切身经历，促使他们在对华决策中注重维持底线常态，不跌入冷战谷底的同时，期待从中美关系中实现美国诉求。	<br><br>
 在缺乏历史参照物的情况下，人们无法验证奥巴马小圈子的外交决策是否真的“业余”。但可以肯定的是，奥巴马至少将民主党外交专才储备的代际更迭进行了提速，40多岁平均年龄的小圈子成员在奥巴马政府8年经验的积累之后，极可能在未来20年的美国外交舞台上继续扮演某种角色。当然，前提是不要再出现一个“奥巴马”和他的“小圈子”。	<br><br>
Denis Richard McDonough (born December 2, 1969) is the 27th and current White House Chief of Staff, succeeding Jack Lew during President Obama's second term.[	<br><br>
McDonough was born on December 2, 1969, in Stillwater, Minnesota.[2] He was one of eleven children of William and Kathleen McDonough.[3] McDonough attended Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, where he played safety on the Johnnies football team for Hall of Fame coach John Gagliardi.[4][5] McDonough was a member of teams that won two conference titles in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.[4] McDonough graduated from Saint John's University with a B.A. summa cum laude in history and Spanish in 1992.[4] He was raised in a devout Catholic family.[6]	<br><br>
After graduation, McDonough traveled extensively throughout Latin America and taught high school in Belize.[4] He then attended Georgetown University and graduated with an MSFS degree from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in 1996.[4]	<br><br>
Early career[edit]	<br><br>
From 1996 to 1999, McDonough worked as an aide to the House Foreign Affairs Committee,[7] where he focused on Latin America.[2] McDonough then served as a senior foreign policy advisor to Senator Tom Daschle.[4] After Daschle's re-election defeat in 2004, McDonough became legislative director for newly elected Senator Ken Salazar.[4] McDonough later served as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in 2004.[2]	<br><br>
In 2007, Senator Barack Obama's chief foreign policy advisor, Navy reservist Mark Lippert, was called into active duty and recruited McDonough to serve as his replacement during Lippert's deployment to Iraq.[4][8] McDonough continued to serve as a senior foreign policy advisor to Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.[2][9]	<br><br>
Obama administration[edit]	<br><br>
After President Obama's election, he joined the administration as the National Security Council's head of Strategic Communication.[7] He also served as National Security Council Chief of Staff.[10]	<br><br>

On October 22, 2010, President Barack Obama announced that McDonough would be replacing Thomas E. Donilon as Deputy National Security Advisor, who was leaving his position to succeed General James L. Jones as National Security Advisor.[11] McDonough was seen in photos of the White House Situation Room taken during the monitoring of the SEAL operation in Pakistan that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011.	<br><br>
On January 25, 2013, Obama appointed Denis McDonough as his Chief of Staff. In February 2013 McDonough urged lawmakers to quickly confirm Chuck Hagel and John O. Brennan to their posts in Obama’s national security team, expressing “grave concern” about the delays.	<br><br>
As Chief of Staff, the former Congressional staffer has made greater outreach to Republican Senators a major priority, with several Republicans referring to his tenure as Chief of Staff as a breath of fresh air.[12]	<br><br>
Chief of Staff Denis McDonough	<br><br>
Denis McDonough is currently serving as the President Barack Obama’s Chief of Staff, a position he assumed in February 2013. Prior to assuming this role, he served as the Deputy National Security Advisor from October 2010 to January 2013. He also served as the Chief of Staff of the National Security Staff and as the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications.	<br><br>
Prior to arriving at the White House, McDonough served as a senior advisor on foreign policy issues on the Presidential Transition Team and on President Obama’s 2008 campaign. Prior to that, he was a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress. McDonough has also worked in the Congress, including as Foreign Policy Advisor for Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle.	<br><br>
McDonough graduated from St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, and has a master's from Georgetown University. A native of Stillwater, Minnesota, McDonough currently lives in Maryland with his wife Kari and three children.	<br><br>
The Mystery Of Denis McDonough	<br><br>
The low-key man running the White House in Barack Obama’s worst year. 	<br><br>

 Ben Smith  	<br><br>
BuzzFeed Staff	<br><br>
Denis McDonough has spent more time running America than perhaps anyone else who has never been the subject of a satisfying profile. 	<br><br>
The New Republic captured something important in 2009 with a piece that reflected McDonough’s obsession with “regular order.” The Times sweetened the beat with a Saturday profile in 2010; the Daily Beast captured slightly more of his “savage” edge and personality this January. Remarkably, BuzzFeed’s Rosie Gray was the only one to remark on what has always struck me as a central, and poignant, biographical detail: that McDonough played a key role in authorizing the Iraq War in 2003.	<br><br>
White House staffers were notably unhelpful when BuzzFeed asked for an interview with him this month. The Times’s Peter Baker managed, at least, to get the White House chief of staff to talk on the record about himself Wednesday, pretty much a first. But one of the core mysteries of this White House remains.	<br><br>
The mystery of Denis McDonough is very much the mystery of why President Barack Obama’s second term is going so badly. Here, for people who watch the building closely, is the underlying conundrum: The Obama White House has never worked better, on a day-to-day level. The chief of staff, for once, actually gets along with the other power brokers in the building: Michelle Obama; Valerie Jarrett; Peter Rouse ― there are none of the sharp elbows and infighting that came with Rahm Emanuel’s or David Axelrod’s ill-concealed distrust of Jarrett, in particular. He is the first to learn the names of junior staffers. He sends thank you cards. “The paradox of Denis is that he’s so unfailingly courteous to people that he works with, and yet is an incredible hardass,” a former White House staffer said. 	<br><br>
But the outcomes have never been worse.	<br><br>
“The White House actually runs day-to-day a lot better than it ever has,” said a second former White House staffer, who credited McDonough’s roots in the process-obsessed foreign policy world. “You have meetings, you have agendas, when you’re done with the meeting you decide who is going to do what, and then there’s accountability for it getting done.”	<br><br>
And yet: McDonough took over as White House chief of staff on Jan. 25, and what has followed has been a pretty terrible year. The president’s top legislative priority, fixing immigration laws, has stalled out. His plan to stop Syria’s descent into chaos was a pure debacle. And the implementation of his most important domestic policy accomplishment, the health care overhaul, is a mess. Obama is less popular than ever.	<br><br>
McDonough, who rose from being a staffer to a junior Western senator before the 2008 campaign to one of America’s most powerful unelected positions, has generally avoided blame, or even attention. This is partly because he is a modest guy who never flew too close to the sun of a high media profile in the happier first term. It’s partly because he is widely seen as a decent and tireless person, the hardest worker in a building of obsessives. It’s partly because he is so close to the president that blame naturally falls on Obama himself. It’s partly because he hasn’t tried too hard to deflect blame.	<br><br>
“I’m a keep-score guy; I always have been,” McDonough told Baker. “So I’m good with the idea that there are scores being kept.”	<br><br>
And yet McDonough’s no-profile public approach shouldn’t mask the two most important things about the role he has played this year. First, he is a chief of staff for a self-actualized president. Obama hired seasoned Washington figures ― Rahm Emanuel, Jack Lew, and Bill Daley ― in his first term. McDonough is the first chief of staff who is younger than the president, the first whose career depends on Obama. He is, beyond that, very close to the president.	<br><br>
He is “as close as a staffer can be,” said former National Security spokesman Tommy Vietor.	<br><br>
The upside of that relationship is that McDonough speaks for Obama and has access to him in a way that Daley, in particular, never did. The downside is that the chaotic testing of ideas and plans that came with Emanuel ― who opposed the entire health care plan, and whose opposition leaked to the press ― has been replaced by a kind of steely internal consensus, in which McDonough is less a broker of internal debate than an enforcer of the presidential will; McDonough’s side ― that is, Obama’s ― usually wins, as it did when he defeated Samantha Power’s arguments for a stronger American hand in Syria.	<br><br>
“There’s a pro and a con about being so trusted and loved by the president that you don’t push him back,” said the second former White House staffer. “If you have so many people around the president who are really friends then you don’t have that team of rivals thing that was a healthy give and take.”	<br><br>
The second key fact about McDonough’s tenure is that his career has been spent in foreign policy, and with Lew ― a former OMB director ― gone, it is not in fact immediately clear who is the top domestic policy staffer. It’s a contrast that can be seen in the structure of two policies: Talks with Iran were conducted in total secrecy and with intense focus by the most senior, talented diplomats the American government could produce, and with close and careful attention to the White House. The health care rollout was managed by a middle-manager at a non-cabinet agency; it’s unthinkable that a desk officer at the State Department would control the implementation of a vital foreign policy move.	<br><br>
Indeed, McDonough remains very deeply involved in the foreign policy weeds. John Kerry’s aides at the State Department, a source said, were surprised to find McDonough himself ready to go to war to put his and Obama’s allies ― rather than Kerry’s ― into even relatively junior “Schedule C” posts. 	<br><br>
“No one owns domestic policy the way Rahm did,” said a former Emanuel aide. 	<br><br>
The Obama presidency has, like most, been one in which strengths are interchangeable with weaknesses: There’s confidence or arrogance; discipline or insularity; centralized control or a failure to delegate. And the second term, difficult so far, is still beginning. But understanding the term will probably mean paying more attention to Denis McDonough.	<br><br>

Denis McDonough Supported Intelligence Oversight When Bush Was President	<br><br>
 Posted:  10/28/2014	<br><br>
WASHINGTON -- In 2006, with the Bush administration resisting efforts by Congress to look into the execution of its global war on terror, the Center for American Progress published a thorough document outlining the role of transparency in democracy. 	<br><br>
“Previous Senate and House Members of the intelligence committees were notably different from their successors today," the report lamented. "They were more interested in performing their oversight function responsibly than in protecting the executive branch when a committee member was of the same party."	<br><br>
The paper's lead author: Denis McDonough.	<br><br>
Today, it's McDonough, the White House chief of staff, who is protecting the executive branch from Senate Democrats fighting to perform their oversight function.	<br><br>
But in 2006, Center for American Progress fellow McDonough was deeply unsatisfied with the state of intelligence oversight in the U.S. Congress. It’s “completely lacking” and soft, he wrote in his report on the subject, and the committees are far too deferential to the executive branch.	<br><br>
“The historically collegial and cooperative Senate Intelligence Committee has been overtaken by partisanship, with the Committee majority completely abdicating to the executive on matters of oversight,” he wrote.	<br><br>
Obama’s chief has taken a surprisingly hands-on role in combating the Intelligence Committee's efforts to declassify as much of the committee’s report on the CIA’s post-9/11 torture program as possible. The negotiations have been stalled by refusals on behalf of the White House and agency to declassify information the panel insists should be made public.	<br><br>
Originally drawn into the declassification negotiations at the committee’s request, the White House and McDonough have mired the public release of the report’s 500-page executive summary in a protracted battle over redactions. 	<br><br>
The negotiations have now stretched more than six months since the panel first voted to declassify the document, dashing hopes that the White House’s involvement would mean more transparency into the Bush-era program.	<br><br>
Instead, with McDonough leading the process, Pennsylvania Avenue has aligned itself largely in defense of its spy agency, pitting itself in a battle over congressional oversight. But in 2006, that was a battle McDonough chastised the intelligence committees for failing to fight.	<br><br>
“The record is rife with evidence that congressional oversight is completely lacking today,” he wrote in his Center for American Progress report. Intelligence Committees of old, he said, found true importance in challenging their powerful administrations. “At its core, this shared vision was more about the importance of the balancing role of the legislative branch as coequal to the executive branch. Such a vision is sorely lacking today.” 	<br><br>
Despite the White House’s current role as facilitator in the dispute over the panel’s CIA report, in 2006 McDonough hailed congressional intelligence oversight as “critical” and warned that its collapse would not bode well for the nation.	<br><br>
“Congressional oversight of intelligence is even more critical than it is for those areas that are more easily accessible to the general public,” he wrote. “This breakdown should be a source of great concern as it threatens to further weaken the intelligence committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate just when outside observers are calling for more effective oversight mechanisms.”	<br><br>
The White House declined to comment on the 2006 report.	<br><br>
Some lawmakers say the large swaths of redactions to the congressional report will prevent a full public accounting of the CIA's enhanced interrogation program, in which suspected terrorists were shipped to overseas secret prisons and subjected to techniques such as waterboarding. 	<br><br>
Much of intelligence agency work takes place under the shroud of extreme secrecy. Congressional overseers -- members and staff alike -- do not know what they do not know, 2006 McDonough warned.	<br><br>
His previous words may serve as encouragement to the lawmakers he’s now stacked against.	<br><br>
“The McDonough of 2006 has a message for the Senate Intelligence Committee of today: Don't give up, don't abdicate -- fight for what you believe to be right. That's the only way to fulfill your responsibilities,” said Steven Aftergood, the director of the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, which works to increase government transparency on national security issues.	<br><br>
Indeed, McDonough’s 2006 assertions found support from the Intelligence committee members who have balked at the White House’s obfuscation.	<br><br>
“Sen. Wyden agrees that that strong oversight of intelligence programs is vital in a democratic government. Effective oversight requires intelligence agency leaders to be straightforward and truthful, and not mired in a culture of misinformation,” said Keith Chu, Sen. Ron Wyden's (D-Ore.) press secretary.	<br><br>
Wyden, for one, has pulled no punches in castigating the executive branch for its attempts to black substantial information out of the public version of the report’s executive summary.	<br><br>
“This report should’ve been out a long time ago. I tried to make that clear. We’ve been at this for months and months, and we’ve gone through ludicrous redactions,” he told HuffPost last week. “What this is really all about is trying to bury as many key facts as possible in order to prevent the real accounting.”	<br><br>
Negotiations over the report’s public release are still ongoing.	<br><br>
Samantha Power (born September 21, 1970) is an Irish-born American academic, author and diplomat who currently serves as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations.[1]	<br><br>
Power began her career by covering the Yugoslav Wars as a journalist. From 1998 to 2002 Power served as the Founding Executive Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, where she later served as the Anna Lindh Professor of Practice of Global Leadership and Public Policy. She was a senior adviser to Senator Barack Obama until March 2008, when she resigned from his presidential campaign after apologizing for referring to then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as "a monster".[2]	<br><br>
Power joined the Obama State Department transition team in late November 2008, and was named Special Assistant to President Obama and Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights on the National Security Council ― responsible for running the Office of Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights ― positions that she held from January 2009 to March 2013. In April 2012, Obama chose her to chair a newly formed Atrocities Prevention Board. During her time in office, Power's office focused on such issues as the reform of the UN; the promotion of women's rights and LGBT rights; the promotion of religious freedom and the protection of religious minorities; the protection of refugees; the campaign against human trafficking; and the promotion of human rights and democracy, including in the Middle East and North Africa, Sudan, and Burma. She is considered to be a key figure within the Obama administration in persuading the president to intervene militarily in Libya.[2] As of 2014, she is listed as the 63rd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[3]	<br><br>
Power has written or co-edited four books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, a study of the U.S. foreign policy response to genocide.	<br><br>
Raised in Ireland until she was nine, Power lived in Castleknock and was schooled in Mount Anville Montessori, Goatstown, Dublin[4] until her parents immigrated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1979.[5] She attended Lakeside High School in Atlanta, where she was a member of the cross country team and the basketball team. She subsequently graduated from Yale University.	<br><br>
From 1993 to 1996, she worked as a journalist, covering the Yugoslav Wars for U.S. News & World Report, The Boston Globe, The Economist, and The New Republic. When she returned to the United States, she attended Harvard Law School, receiving her J.D. in 1999. The following year, she published her first book, Realizing Human Rights: Moving from Inspiration to Impact (edited with Graham Allison), a compilation of essays by leading human-rights scholars and practitioners. Her second book, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, grew out of a paper she wrote while attending law school. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction and the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize[6] in 2003. It offers a survey of the origin of the word genocide, the major genocides of the 20th century, as well as an analysis of some of the underlying reasons for the persistent failure of governments and the international community to collectively identify, recognize and then respond effectively to genocides ranging from the Armenian Genocide to the Rwandan Genocide. This work and related writings received criticism from historian Howard Zinn for downplaying the importance of "unintended" and "collateral" civilian deaths that could be classified as genocidal;[7] and also by Edward S. Herman[8] and Joseph Nevins[9]	<br><br>
Power is a scholar of United States foreign policy, especially as it relates to human rights and genocide. From 1998 to 2002, Power served as the Founding Executive Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, where she later served as the Anna Lindh Professor of Practice of Global Leadership and Public Policy.	<br><br>
In 2004, Power was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world that year.[10] In fall 2007, she began writing a regular column for Time. Power appears in Charles Ferguson's 2007 documentary about the war in Iraq, No End in Sight, which alleges numerous missteps by the Bush administration.	<br><br>
Power spent 2005C06 working in the office of U.S. Senator Barack Obama as a foreign policy fellow, where she was credited with sparking and directing Obama's interest in the Darfur conflict.[11] She served as a senior foreign policy adviser to Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, but stepped down after referring to Hillary Clinton as "a monster".[12] Power apologized for the remarks made in an interview with The Scotsman in London, and resigned from the campaign shortly thereafter.[13]	<br><br>
Her third book, Chasing the Flame: Sergio Vieira de Mello and the Fight to Save the World, was released on February 14, 2008. It concerns Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations Special Representative in Iraq who was killed in the Canal Hotel bombing in Baghdad along with Jean-Sélim Kanaan, Nadia Younes, Fiona Watson, and other members of his staff, on the afternoon of August 19, 2003. The book was the basis for the documentary film Sergio, directed by Greg Barker and edited by Karen Schmeer.	<br><br>
Her fourth book, The Unquiet American: Richard Holbrooke in the World (edited with Derek Chollet), is an edited compilation of writings by Holbrooke's friends and colleagues, along with notable essays by Holbrooke himself.	<br><br>
Personal life[edit]	<br><br>
 Church of Mary Immaculate, Lohar, Waterville, Co Kerry, Ireland	<br><br>
On July 4, 2008, Power married law professor Cass Sunstein, whom she met while working on the Obama campaign.[14] They were married in the Church of Mary Immaculate, near Waterville on the Ring of Kerry in Power's native Ireland. On April 24, 2009, she gave birth to their first child, Declan Power Sunstein.[15] On June 1, 2012, she gave birth to their second child, a daughter, Rían Power Sunstein.	<br><br>
Views[edit]	<br><br>
Alongside her advocacy for Barack Obama's candidacy, Power is best known for her efforts to increase public awareness of genocide and human rights abuses, particularly in the Darfur conflict. In 2006, she contributed to Screamers, a movie about the Darfur, Armenian, and other genocides of the 20th and 21st centuries. While Power was a leading voice calling for armed intervention to prevent mass atrocities in the Balkans and Libya,[16] she emphasizes that the United States has many non-military options for responding: "If you think of foreign policy as a toolbox, there are a whole range of options―you can convene allies, impose economic sanctions, expel ambassadors, jam hate radio. There is always something you can do."[17]	<br><br>
Her advocacy of humanitarian intervention has been criticized for being tendentious and militaristic, for answering a "problem from hell" with a "solution from hell."[18] Furthermore, Power's advocacy of deploying the United States armed forces to combat human rights abuses has been criticized as running contrary to the idea that the main purpose of the military is the furnishment of national defense.[19]	<br><br>
Some individuals have accused Power of being hostile towards Israel, largely on the basis of statements she made in a 2002 interview with Harry Kreisler. When asked what advice she would give to the president if either the Israelis or Palestinians looked "like they might be moving toward genocide," Power said that the United States might consider the deployment of a "mammoth protection force" to monitor developments between the Israelis and Palestinians, characterizing it as a regrettable but necessary "imposition of a solution on unwilling parties," and "the lesser of evils."[20] She clarified that remark on several occasions, including in an interview with Haaretz correspondent Shmuel Rosner in August 2008.[21] Many strong supporters of Israel have dismissed the charge that she is not a friend of Israel, including Alan Dershowitz,[22] Rabbi Shmuley Boteach,[23] Martin Peretz,[24] and Max Boot.[25] Boteach, who recently ran as a Republican congressional candidate in New Jersey, recalled that "she rejected utterly the notion she had any animus toward Israel [during their conversation]. She acknowledged that she had erred significantly in offering hypothetical comments that did not reflect how she felt." In an article that he published after her nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the UN, he stated that "as a Jew I am in awe of Samantha's achievement in emerging as the foremost voices against genocide in our time and I absolutely believe in her strong commitment to Israel's long-term security."[26] According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, "[a]fter joining the Obama team in 2009 as a member of the National Security Council ― a post she left in February ― she assuaged many concerns [about her commitment to Israel], first by joining [Susan] Rice in taking the lead against the singling out of Israel at the United Nations. It was Power's call, ultimately, to keep the United States out of Durban II, a 2009 reprise of the 2001 conference on racism in South Africa that devolved into a festival of Israel bashing."[27] Power's best known book, A Problem from Hell, does not discuss Israel.	<br><br>
2008 presidential campaign[edit]	<br><br>
Power was an early and outspoken supporter of Barack Obama. When she joined the Obama campaign as a foreign policy advisor, Men's Vogue described her as a "Harvard brainiac who can boast both a Pulitzer Prize and a mean jump shot (ask George Clooney). Now the consummate outsider is working on her inside game: D.C. politics."[28]	<br><br>
In August 2007 Power authored a memo titled "Conventional Washington versus the Change We Need," in which she provided one of the first comprehensive statements of Obama's approach to foreign policy. In the memo she writes: "Barack Obama's judgment is right; the conventional wisdom is wrong. We need a new era of tough, principled and engaged American diplomacy to deal with 21st century challenges."[29]	<br><br>
In February and March 2008, Power began an international book tour to promote her book, Chasing the Flame. Because of her involvement in the Obama campaign, many of the interviews she gave revolved around her and Barack Obama's foreign-policy views, as well as the 2008 campaign.	<br><br>
On February 21, Power appeared on Charlie Rose and compared Barack Obama to Sergio Vieira de Mello, who is the subject of Chasing the Flame. "This would be Sergio's lesson: if you are not thinking in terms of both dignity and freedom from fear, and this is the other thing Obama has come back to, the old Rooseveltian idea. Obama has tried to run a campaign that moves us out of the politics of fear. He is also very sensitive to the degree to which, and Sergio uses this line, 'fear is a bad adviser.' This is a line that could have come out of Obama's mouth, though happened to come out of Sergio's mouth. We make bad judgments when we are afraid."[30]	<br><br>
Power appeared on BBC's HARDtalk on March 6, stating that Barack Obama's pledge to "have all U.S. combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months"[31] was a "best case scenario" that "he will revisit when he becomes president."[32] Challenged by the host as to whether this contradicted Obama's campaign commitment, she responded, "You can’t make a commitment in March 2008 about what circumstances will be like in January 2009.... He will, of course, not rely on some plan that he’s crafted as a presidential candidate or a U.S. Senator. He will rely upon a plan ― an operational plan ― that he pulls together in consultation with people who are on the ground to whom he doesn’t have daily access now, as a result of not being the president."[33] She concluded by saying that "what we can take seriously is that he will try to get U.S. forces out of Iraq as quickly and responsibly as possible."[32] In February 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. would end combat operations in Iraq by August 31, 2010 and withdraw all U.S. soldiers by the end of 2011. The U.S. formally ended its mission in Iraq on December 15 of that year.	<br><br>
In a March 6 interview with The Scotsman, she said: "We fucked up in Ohio. In Ohio, they are obsessed and Hillary is going to town on it, because she knows Ohio's the only place they can win".[34][35] "She is a monster, too ― that is off the record ― she is stooping to anything... if you are poor and she is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your job away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has put forward is really unattractive."	<br><br>
Power apologized for the remarks on the night of the March 6 interview, saying that they "do not reflect my feelings about Sen. Clinton, whose leadership and public service I have long admired," and telling Irish TV reporter Michael Fisher: "Of course I regret them. I can't even believe they came out of my mouth....in every public appearance I've ever made talking about Senator Clinton, I have sung her praises as the leader she has been, the intellect. She's also incredibly warm, funny....I wish I could go back in time."[36] The next day, in the wake of reaction to the remarks, she resigned from the Obama campaign.[37] Soon afterward, the Weekly Standard said that it "might have been the most ill-starred book tour since the invention of movable type."[38]	<br><br>
Following her resignation, she also appeared on The Colbert Report on March 17, 2008, saying, "can I just clarify and say, I don't think Hillary Clinton is a monster...we have three amazing candidates left in the race." When Power later joined the State Department transition team, an official close to the transition said Power had apologized and that her "gesture to bury the hatchet" with Clinton had been well received.[39] Power attended Clinton's swearing-in ceremony on February 2 and collaborated with her during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State.	<br><br>
Obama administration[edit]	<br><br>
 Power speaking at Harvard Law School's Class Day (2010)	<br><br>
After the 2008 presidential election, Power returned to Obama's team, becoming a member of the transition team, working for the Department of State[40] and the U.S. Mission to the UN. In January 2009 President Obama appointed Power to the National Security Council Staff, where she served as a Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director running the Office of Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights.[41]	<br><br>
Upon her departure from the White House to take up the position as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Abramowitz, Director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Center for the Prevention of Genocide said: "There is a small group of people that really care about genocide prevention and prevention of mass atrocities, and we all appreciate that we had a real champion for those issue at the highest levels of government. She worked very hard to strengthen the interagency treatment of these issues, and she had a great deal of passion for those issues, and she brought that passion to the government."[42]	<br><br>
Advocate for military intervention in Libya[edit]	<br><br>
Samantha Power is considered to be a key figure within the Obama administration in persuading the president to intervene militarily in Libya.[43] Power argues that America has a moral obligation to examine all tools in the toolbox (diplomatic, economic, political, and military) to respond to mass atrocity, and she has argued that there may be circumstances in which military intervention may be appropriate to prevent genocides.[citation needed] Within the White House, Power strongly pressed for U.S. intervention on humanitarian grounds.[citation needed] She has been described as instrumental in convincing Obama to push for a UN Security Council resolution to authorize a coalition military force to protect Libyan civilians.[44] Power has previously argued that "you don't get any extra credit for doing the right thing". "It's up to us" to change that calculus, she said. "My prescription," she said, "would be that the level of American and international engagement would ratchet up commensurate with the abuse on the ground."[45]	<br><br>
U.S. ambassador to the UN[edit]	<br><br>
Nomination[edit]	<br><br>
On June 5, 2013, the President Barack Obama announced her nomination as the new United States Ambassador to the United Nations.[46] In remarks at the announcement, Power said: "Even as a little girl with a thick Dublin accent who had never been to America, I knew that the American flag was the symbol of fortune and of freedom....I came home from school every day, as my mother can attest, my dad can attest, and I sat in front of the mirrors for hours, straining to drop my brogue so that I, too, could quickly speak and be American."[47]	<br><br>
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) said: "I support President Obama's nomination of Samantha Power to become the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. I believe she is well-qualified for this important position and hope the Senate will move forward on her nomination as soon as possible."[48] Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called her "solid choice to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. As United Nations Ambassador, Samantha Power will aggressively represent the United States interests in an increasingly hostile body. Power will also be a strong supporter of the United States' close ally Israel.[49] Former Senator Joseph Lieberman (I-CT) said that he is "very encouraged by the president's appointment."[50] Dennis Ross stated that "Sam Power brings lots of experience to the job and will be a powerful voice representing America's interests and values."[51] Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote: "We are pleased that President Obama has nominated a true champion of human rights who led the effort to make averting genocide and atrocities a core part of American policy to head the U.S. delegation at the United Nations...She experienced first-hand the hostility faced by Israel and the abuse of the U.N. bodies to promote anti-Israel bias. As someone who appreciates, to the core of her being, the meaning of international human rights mechanisms, Samantha is clear eyed and understands the injustice of their abuse to target Israel's legitimacy."[52] Israel's Ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, noted that "Samantha Power and I have worked closely over the last four years on issues vital to Israel's security. She thoroughly understands those issues and cares deeply about them."[53] Professor Dershowitz reiterated his strong support for Power: "She's a perfect choice. A perfect choice. She has real credibility to expose the U.N.'s double standard on human rights. She also understands the principle of 'the worst first'―you go after the worst human rights abusers first."[22] Lawyers for Cholera Victims also see her nomination as an opportunity for the US to pressure the UN to respond justly to the cholera epidemic. Director of the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti cites her "long and effective record of support for the rule of law, especially international law,” as a sign that she will stand up for accountability for the victims of UN cholera in Haiti.[54] The Director of the Israel Project, Josh Block, noted that "Samantha has made a commendable effort to build ties with the pro-Israel community and develop deeper appreciation of the issues vital to our interests in the region, Israel's security, and the U.S.-Israel relationship.	<br><br>
In her role at the United States National Security Council, she also helped lead the administration's efforts opposing the Palestinian bid to circumvent peace negotiations with Israel with unilateralism at the U.N."[55] The Jewish Council for Public Affairs noted that it has "worked closely with Samantha Power over the years in her roles as journalist, activist, and government official. Power has been a critical voice on human rights issues and we are very proud of our joint work to confront atrocities, including that in Darfur and the ongoing crisis in Sudan."[56] The President of the Rabbinical Assembly, Gerald Skolnik, said that the Assembly "look[s] forward to working with Samantha Power in her new role as UN Ambassador on our mutual interests of defending universal human rights and Israeli security.[57] The Eastern Director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Steven Burg, tweeted that she is a "great choice."[58] The National Jewish Democratic Council said that "Power, the country's foremost scholar on genocide and an outspoken advocate for human rights, represents some of the Jewish community's most important values."[59] A recently posted document gives several examples of pro-Israel, Republican support for her.[60]	<br><br>
Her nomination was also opposed by a number of people. Former US ambassador to the UN John R. Bolton and former US Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy Frank Gaffney criticized her for a 2003 article in The New Republic that she wrote in which she compared the United States to Nazi Germany.[61]	<br><br>
Power was confirmed as UN ambassador by the U.S. Senate on August 1, 2013, by a vote of 87 to 10, and was sworn in a day later by the Vice President.[62][63]	<br><br>
Tenure[edit]	<br><br>
Speaking in September 2013, Power told a news conference that the American intelligence findings “overwhelmingly point to one stark conclusion: The Assad regime perpetrated an attack.” She added, “The actions of the Assad regime are morally reprehensible, and they violate clearly established international norms.”	<br><br>
Power went on to criticize the failure of the United Nations structure to thwart or prosecute the atrocities committed in the Syrian conflict, which is now well into its third year. She said, “The system devised in 1945 precisely to deal with threats of this nature did not work as it was supposed to.”	<br><br>
She added "Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to hold the council hostage and shirk its international responsibilities. "What we have learned, what the Syrian people have learned, is that the Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the Security Council we have."[64]	<br><br>
In 2014, speaking on the crisis in Ukraine, Ambassador Power, told reporters that Washington was "gravely disturbed by reports of Russian military deployments into the Crimea. "The United States calls upon Russia to pull back the military forces that are being built up in the region, to stand down, and to allow the Ukrainian people the opportunity to pursue their own government, create their own destiny and to do so freely without intimidation or fear," she said. Power declined to characterise Russian military actions when asked if they constituted aggression. She called for an independent international mediation mission to be quickly dispatched to Ukraine.[65]	<br><br>
In July 2014 Power said the GLBT rights movement is “far from over” in spite of significant progress in this country. “There are some parts of the world where the situation abroad is actually taking a sharp turn for the worse for LGBT individuals,” she said during a forum at Hunter College commemorating the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Power noted that homosexuality remains criminalized in nearly 80 countries. She said Brunei would become the eighth country in which those found guilty of consensual same-sex sexual acts face the death penalty if it “continues along its path” of enacting its new penal code. Power highlighted the law that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signed in February 2014 that imposes a life sentence upon anyone found guilty of repeated same-sex sexual acts. She also noted Russia and Nigeria as among the other countries in which anti-LGBT statutes have come into effect over the last year. “Unfortunately, Uganda’s anti-gay legislation is not an outlier,” said Power. “Nor is the climate of intolerance and abuse that it has fostered.” Power spoke at the forum a week after the Obama administration announced travel bans against Ugandan officials who are responsible for anti-LGBT human rights abuses. Her speech also coincided with the first anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act.[66]	<br><br>
As of 2014, she is listed as the 63rd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[	<br><br>

A complicated hero in the war on dictatorship	<br><br>
Samantha Power	<br><br>
Feb-08	<br><br>
 TED Speech 	<br><br>
Would you negotiate with someone you knew to be evil, to save lives? Samantha Power tells a story of a complicated hero, Sergio Vieira de Mello. This UN diplomat walked a thin moral line, negotiating with the world's worst dictators to help their people survive crisis. It's a compelling story told with a fiery passion.	<br><br>
Mark William Lippert (born February 28, 1973) is the current United States Ambassador to South Korea. He was formerly the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense, and previously served as Chief of Staff for the National Security Council and as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs in the Department of Defense.	<br><br>
Education and early career[edit]	<br><br>
Lippert was born in and grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio.[1] His father, James Lippert, is a lawyer.[2] Lippert graduated from Stanford University where he studied political science. While he considered entering Officer Candidate School after college, he returned to Stanford and received a master's degree in international policy studies.[3] While in graduate school at Stanford, he studied Mandarin Chinese at Peking University as part of a study abroad program.	<br><br>
Prior to 1999, he worked at the State Department and for California Senator Dianne Feinstein. Lippert was a defense and foreign policy advisor to then Senator and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and the Senate Democratic Policy Committee from 1999 to October 2000. He then served as a researcher for Senator Patrick Leahy from October 2000 to February 2001. Lippert served on the professional staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee, StateCForeign Operations Subcommittee, from February 2001 to June 2005.[4] In June 2005, he became a foreign policy advisor to then Senator Barack Obama, who was then serving on the Senate Foreign Relations committee.[4] He was recruited by Senator Obama's then Chief of Staff, Pete Rouse, who is currently serving as Counselor to the President.[2]	<br><br>
Lippert was also commissioned into the Navy Reserve in 2005 through the Navy's direct commission officer program as an intelligence officer. From August 2007 until June 2008, he served about a year[3] in what had been scheduled as a nine-month tour of duty in Iraq as an intelligence officer with the Navy SEALs. He received a Bronze Star Medal for his service in Iraq.[4]	<br><br>
After he returned from Iraq, Lippert served as a senior foreign policy advisor to then Senator Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.[4] He was responsible for briefing Obama on emerging foreign policy issues throughout the campaign.[5] He helped prepare Obama on foreign policy for the presidential debates.[6] Lippert later served as deputy director for foreign policy for the ObamaCBiden Transition Project.[4]	<br><br>
Throughout his time in the Senate and during the presidential campaign, Lippert was noted for having a close relationship with then Senator Obama.[3] He is credited for helping Obama develop his views on defense and foreign policy, particularly his support for a withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, which was completed under President Obama in December 2011 as well as Obama's emphasis on transnational security issues, such as genocide and weapons of mass destruction.[2]	<br><br>
Obama administration[edit]	<br><br>
Following Obama's inauguration in January 2009, he was appointed Deputy Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff for the National Security Council, a position which had not existed in the Bush administration, but had existed in previous administrations.[7] During his time as Chief of Staff, Lippert oversaw the merger of the staffs of the Homeland Security Council, which had been created in October 2009 by President Bush, and the National Security Council, into a single National Security Staff.[8] Unlike his recent predecessors, then National Security Advisor and retired Marine Corps General, Jim Jones, delegated much of the day-to-day responsibilities for the National Security Council to his deputy, Thomas Donilon, and to a couple of Obama campaign veterans, including Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert.[9]	<br><br>
In October 2009, Lippert resigned from the National Security Council to return to active duty in the Navy.[10] There was speculation surrounding Lippert's resignation that he was pushed to leave due to significant disagreements with General Jones, especially with respect to the troop surge.[7] Jones accused Lippert of leaking information about him to Bob Woodward for Obama's Wars.[11] Lippert was succeeded by Denis McDonough, who served as National Security Council Chief of Staff until October 2010, when he became Deputy National Security Advisor. Lippert had originally recruited McDonough to serve as then Senator Obama's foreign policy advisor during his deployment to Iraq. McDonough was in turn replaced in January 2011 by Brooke Anderson, then deputy to Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice.[12]	<br><br>
Lippert spent two years serving as an intelligence officer with the Navy SEALs and the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, better known by its former name, SEAL Team Six, including deployments to Afghanistan and undisclosed locations in Africa. He continued to be on the White House payroll while on active duty, which is permitted by federal law, but caused some controversy.[13]	<br><br>
After completing his active duty with the Navy, Lippert was nominated by President Obama in October 2011 to succeed General Wallace Gregson as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs.[7] While Lippert's nomination was held up for several months due to holds placed on it by Senators John McCain and John Cornyn Lippert's relationship with former National Security Advisor Jim Jones,[14] and over F-16 sales to Taiwan,[15] respectively, he was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote on April 2012.[11]	<br><br>
When Kurt Campbell resigned as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in February 2013, Lippert was rumoured as a possible replacement for Campbell.[16] Lippert was named newly-confirmed Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's Chief of Staff in early May 2013.[17]	<br><br>
Ambassador nomination, confirmation, and service[edit]	<br><br>
On May 1, 2014, President Obama announced his intention to nominate Lippert to be United States Ambassador to South Korea.[18] The United States Senate voted to confirm Lippert's nomination on September 18, 2014.[19] He was sworn in as the new ambassador by Secretary of State John Kerry in October 2014.	<br><br>
Benjamin J. Rhodes (born 1977) is the current deputy national security adviser for strategic communication for U.S. President Barack Obama. His formal title is "Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and Speechwriting."[1] Rhodes has been a foreign policy speechwriter for Obama since 2007. He is a graduate of New York's Collegiate School,[2] Rice University, and New York University.	<br><br>
Rhodes grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and attended the exclusive Collegiate School, graduating in 1996.[3][4] Rhodes then attended Rice University, graduating in 2000 with majors in English and political science. He then moved back to New York, attending New York University and graduating in 2002 with an MFA in creative writing.[5]	<br><br>
Early political career[edit]	<br><br>
In the summer of 1997, Rhodes volunteered with the Rudy Giuliani mayoral campaign. In the summer of 2001, he worked on the New York City Council campaign of Diana Reyna.[6]	<br><br>
Foreign policy speechwriter[edit]	<br><br>
In 2002, James Gibney, editor of Foreign Policy, introduced Rhodes to Lee Hamilton, former member of the House of Representative and director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who was looking for a speechwriter.[4] Rhodes then spent five years as a Hamilton assistant, helping to draft the Iraq Study Group Report and the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.[7]	<br><br>
In 2007, Rhodes began working as a speechwriter for the 2008 Obama presidential campaign.	<br><br>
Rhodes, who has been described as a realist by The Washington Post,[8] wrote Obama's 2009 Cairo speech "A New Beginning".[9] Rhodes was the adviser who counseled Obama to withdraw support from Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, becoming a key adviser during the 2011 Arab Spring.[10] In March, 2013, Rhodes declined to comment on his role in Obama administration policy decisions, saying, "My main job, which has always been my job, is to be the person who represents the president’s view on these issues."[10]	<br><br>
