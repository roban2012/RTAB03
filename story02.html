Welcome to the Directorate of Intelligence (DI), where incomplete and sometimes contradictory information is transformed into unique insights that inform US policy decisions. Members of the DI help provide timely, accurate, and objective all-source intelligence analysis on the full range of national security and foreign policy issues to the President, Cabinet, and senior policymakers in the US government.	<br><br>
Who We Are
<br><br>


With 29 years (mostly) in the DI, I have had five separate careers, each one building on expertise developed in the previous assignments. I've lived overseas, worked in the White House Situation Room, extensively researched absorbing topics, and had policymakers and colleagues interested in what I've discovered. I've learned an immense amount about the field I studied at university: international relations, but I've also learned so much more about people, systems, politics, critical thinking, writing, briefing, and topics as diverse as sanctions to biography to satellites. I don't have a yacht or a home worth millions, but I have never been bored at work. I've always been challenged to think and work at the most sophisticated levels, and I know that what I have done has helped my country prosper and be safe. The people I work with are intellectually curious, have wide-ranging and surprising interests and knowledge, and possess dynamic, rigorous, and sophisticated thinking standards. They also demonstrate the highest of ethical and personal standards; it is a pleasure to work daily with such impressive people. CJane, manager, 29 years<br><br>


Serving as a first-line manager was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my eleven years with the DI. The intelligence and dedication to the mission of people with whom I've had the pleasure to work never ceased to amaze me. As chief of two highly productive and fast-paced teams―responsible for South Asian and Middle Eastern issues―I was exposed to the best and the worst of the Intelligence Community, and I'm optimistic that the folks manning the analytic trenches are as capable and ready as ever to fight the good fight. Few organizations could have afforded me the wide array of experiences I had prior to management; I've worked in four different DI offices, traveled all over the world, and served as a PDB briefer―briefing the most senior of our Policy customers and meeting the President. CSteve, analytic manager/military analyst, 11 years
<br><br>

As a collection analyst I have had the opportunity to develop technical expertise, brief a wide variety of customers, and travel extensively. I work closely with regional as well as transnational analysts, helping them to leverage collection systems to answer their key questions and further refine their analysis, which in turn is passed on to policymakers. As collection analysis is a relatively small field, analysts have considerable responsibility as well as considerable autonomy in accomplishing their mission. This is a unique and challenging field, and allows you to learn about the varied and formidable resources available to assist other analysts in getting the information they need to help make this country a safer place. CMike, collections analyst, 3.5 years
<br><br>

I came to the Agency from local government and was able to jump right in and work on challenging and timely issues. After receiving my master’s in peace operations, I was not sure where I wanted to work, but the Agency had a need and I was proud to answer the call to serve my country. I’ve been able to write for and brief top officials and diplomats, bringing them up to speed on issues about the United Nations and impacting US policy. In the DI, we often collaborate across offices to bring our collective analytic best forward--and that creates a unique synergy. CIA has great employee morale and an understanding management team that regularly asks for feedback. One of the more exciting aspects of work is having the opportunity to be trained in a variety of skills and subjects, usually with other members of the Intelligence Community. CMichael, political analyst, 2 years 
<br><br>

I was recruited by the Agency from my communications graduate program at American University. I had no idea what was in store for me, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that working in the DI provides a vast range of opportunities and relationships beyond what I had imagined. In my day-to-day job I not only coordinate with analysts covering every region of the world, but I also interact with graphics designers, electronic publishers, and IT developers in order to provide our products to policymakers and a wide variety of customers across the Intelligence Community. The feedback we receive on our products is positive and encouraging; it provides me with a clear sense of the Agency mission and a feeling of accomplishment in directly supporting US policymakers―especially knowing that the products I edit are read by the President on a regular basis!  I also appreciate the “continuous learning” aspect that is advocated throughout the DI―I have been able to attend conferences, training, customer outreach events, and working groups and am consistently encouraged to take advantage of opportunities that will further my professional development. Although I have been at the Agency a short time, I have been able to develop skills quickly that will serve me well in my future career here―I look forward to the new experiences that await me. CJessica, publications officer (editor), 1.5 years<br><br>

 





 
What We Do
<br><br>
Where else could you write an analysis of a world event and have it read by the President?
<br><br>
Where else could you be sure that your report about the impact of a humanitarian emergency in Africa will be seriously considered at the highest levels of our government?
<br><br>
Where else could you be called on to brief US policymakers at the height of an international crisis?
<br><br>
Officers in the CIA’s Directorate of Intelligence (DI) are on the forefront of protecting US national security interests in a fast-changing world. As a DI analyst, your challenge is to anticipate and quickly assess rapidly evolving international developments and their impact, both positive and negative, on US policy concerns. Technological advances have increased the complexity, scope, and speed of potential risks to our national security, and threats can come from farther away, faster, and with less warning than ever before.
<br><br>
The intelligence support that DI officers develop and provide through written products such as the President’s Daily Brief and the World Intelligence Review (WIRe), as well as through other methods is a core function of the Agency. While the CIA does not make foreign policy, our analysis of intelligence on overseas developments feeds into the informed decisions by policymakers and other senior decisionmakers in the national security and defense arenas.
<br><br>
As an analyst, the expertise you bring to the job and continue to develop through your daily work and continuous training will make you part of a process that reaches right to the top of national policy decisions. CIA is a vital part of the nation’s Intelligence Community, both advising and receiving oversight from the executive and legislative branches of the US Government.
<br><br>
Working closely with analysts, our multimedia producers, graphics designers, and cartographers craft products that convey our analytic judgments more effectively. From computer simulations to multi-dimensional maps, graphics specialists draw on their creative expertise to play an active and unique role in supporting the DI’s intelligence mission.
<br><br>
The DI’s mission to analyze a diverse set of countries, issues, and cultures means we look for individuals with a variety of academic backgrounds and disciplines from a variety of institutions. A limited number of undergraduate internships, graduate fellowships, and minority student programs are available. Through the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program, a limited number of scholarships are awarded to highly qualified students specializing in critical subject areas who want to work as DI analysts. All our employees must be US citizens. If you are looking for the chance to contribute, if you like intellectual challenges, if you thrive on a fast-paced environment, and if you want to make a difference, then a career in the DI may be for you.

<br><br>

--The Political Islam Strategic Analysis Program examines those movements and organizations that use religion for political purposes and use religious ideology to attempt to change the existing political, social, or economic order. The effort does not focus on Islam as a religion or on the worldwide Muslim community. <br><br>
FAQs<br><br>



I’m just a junior at my university but really would like to work in the DI. Are there any opportunities for students?
<br><br>
Yes, there are a limited number of openings for outstanding undergraduate and graduate students to work in the DI as interns or grad fellows. We are particularly interested in students specializing in economics, physical sciences, engineering, geography, area studies, international affairs, or political science. These highly competitive positions offer the full range of employee benefits, including health insurance, paid holidays, and possible tuition assistance in some cases. We ask students to apply about nine months before they are available to begin work.<br><br>
 Can DI analysts travel and live overseas?
<br><br>A DI analyst will spend the majority of his/her career at CIA Headquarters. At various points throughout their careers, however, DI analysts may travel overseas on short trips ranging from a few days to several weeks to learn more about the region or topic they have been assigned to follow. In some cases, analysts may spend several months working at an Embassy or in support of US military operations, depending on their responsibilities or language skills. Many analysts also choose to deepen their expertise by competing for an overseas posting that may last up to three years.
<br><br>Will I work on the same topic or region for my entire career?
<br><br>It depends on pressing national security needs, your own interests, and the skills and knowledge you bring to the job. Some analysts choose to concentrate on deepening their substantive expertise and technical command of their topic area, while others may opt to expand their expertise by working at various times on different countries in their chosen region. Regardless of their area of specialty, however, all analysts can broaden their skills as intelligence officers by working on an interagency task force, doing a tour in a policy or law enforcement agency in downtown Washington, or serving in a rotational assignment elsewhere in the Agency or the Intelligence Community.
<br><br>What qualities make a successful DI officer?
<br><br>DI officers come in all sizes, shapes, and temperaments. What they all share, though, is a passion for making a difference and contributing to the national security decisions made by senior policymakers. If you have an intense desire to learn, if you enjoy digging deep into an issue or a region, if you are stimulated by the intellectual challenge of making sense of incomplete and often contradictory information, then working as an analyst in the DI may be just the job for you.
<br><br>How much can I talk about my work with friends and family?
<br><br>In general, you may tell family and friends that you are employed at CIA, although it is advisable to be discreet, both for personal and professional reasons. Because of the classified nature of the Agency’s work, you should not talk to others about the details of your work. Security precautions and restrictions are a fact of life with all CIA jobs.

<br><br>

History<br><br>



The DI was established in 1952 to help the President and other policymakers make informed decisions about our country’s national security. DI analysts look at all the available information on an issue and organize it for policymakers to give them more ideas on how to think about it. The grist for the analysts’ mill is a mix of often incomplete and frequently contradictory fragments of information collected around―and above―the world. From a near-void on vital topics during the early years to an overwhelming volume today, the information has come from a variety of sources and methods, including US personnel overseas as well as agent reports, satellite photography, foreign media, and sophisticated sensors.
<br><br>
Over the years, the DI has covered crises and confrontations, identified trends, and illuminated issues. It has produced timely information and insights available nowhere else and put them into the right hands. In so doing, it informed the decisionmaking that kept the Cold War from becoming a hot war, and it now plays a vital role in waging the global war against terrorism.<br><br>

 

Key Events in DI History 

<br><br>
1940s<br><br>

1946 C The Office of Reports and Estimates (ORE) is created under an interagency Central Intelligence Group to do intelligence research, produce daily analytic reports, and write longer-term National Intelligence Estimates for policymakers.<br><br>

1947 C President Truman signs the National Security Act of 1947 creating the CIA. 

 <br><br>

1950s<br><br>

1950 C Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Walter Bedell Smith divides ORE into three offices: the Office of National Estimates, which produces coordinated “national estimates”; the Office of Research and Report, which conducts basic research; and the Office of Current Intelligence, tasked with writing analytic summaries and other brief products for policymakers.<br><br>

1952 C DCI Smith establishes the Directorate of Intelligence to replace ORE and streamline the production of finished intelligence analysis. President Truman, an avid reader of the Central Intelligence Bulletin, directs CIA to brief presidential candidates Eisenhower and Stevenson, a practice that continues today.
<br><br>
1956 C First U-2 aerial reconnaissance missions; DI analysts play a key role in developing realistic estimates of the size of the Soviet bomber force. 
<br><br>
 

1960s<br><br>

1960 C The Director of Intelligence (DDI) creates a small staff to identify intelligence problems that could benefit from automated information processing support. The staff identifies Soviet defense spending as a key problem and work begins on the Strategic Cost Analysis Model.
<br><br>
1963 C The 24-hour CIA Operations Center is established.
<br><br>
1964 C President Johnson wants his intelligence product at the close of each business day―this becomes the President’s Daily Brief. 
<br><br>
 

1970s<br><br>

1973 C The National Intelligence Officer system is initiated under the National Intelligence Council (NIC) to provide experts to advise and coordinate between agencies on key issues.
<br><br>
1976 C In response to criticism about Intelligence Community analysis on future Soviet military strength, DCI George Bush approves a Team A/Team B competitive analysis exercise as part of the National Intelligence Estimate, “Soviet Forces for Intercontinental Conflict Through the Mid-1980s.”
<br><br>
1977 C The DI is reorganized and renamed the National Foreign Assessment Center (NFAC), which includes a Center for Policy Support and the Offices of Regional and Political Analysis, Scientific Intelligence, and Weapons Intelligence. 
<br><br>
 

1980s
<br><br>
1980 C The Arms Control and Intelligence Staff is established in NFAC for intelligence support on arms control issues.
<br><br>
1981 C NFAC creates the Technology Transfer Assessment Center to do analytic and intelligence support on international technology transfer issues. Later the same year, NFAC is again reorganized and renamed the DI; most functional offices are restructured into interdisciplinary regional offices.
<br><br>
1986 C The Counterterrorism Center is established under the Directorate of Operations to help combat international terrorist threats. DI officers serve in its analytic components to provide regional and functional expertise―the first permanent unit combining analysis and operations.
<br><br>
1988 C The Counterintelligence Center is established; like the Counterterrorism Center, it includes DI officers who provide analytic support.
<br><br>
1989 C The DCI Counternarcotics Center is established to bring together officers from across CIA, the Intelligence Community, law enforcement, and policy agencies. 
<br><br>
 

1990s<br><br>

1992 C The DCI Nonproliferation Center is established to strengthen DI interaction with the policy community on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
<br><br>
1997 C The DI’s five regional analytic offices are reconfigured into three. The DCI Nonproliferation Center adds additional analytic components and establishes a Senior Scientist position, thereby creating the largest concentration of proliferation experts in the Intelligence Community.
<br><br>
1998 C The Jeremiah Commission reviews the Intelligence Community’s performance on India and its unannounced nuclear test; the Commission offers recommendations to enhance the Community’s analytic warning capabilities. The DI’s Office of Policy Support is established to improve the quality of DI support to the policy community.
<br><br>
1999 C In December, the DI creates the Sherman Kent School For Intelligence Analysis to strengthen the professional understanding, expertise, and skills of intelligence analysts and those who manage them. 
<br><br>
 

2000s
<br><br>
2000 C The first Career Analyst Program (CAP) class graduates from the Sherman Kent School in November, establishing the CAP as the core professional learning program for all new analysts joining CIA.
<br><br>
2001 C The DCI Center for Weapons Intelligence, Nonproliferation, and Arms Control is established, bringing together experts on all types of foreign weapons threats into one center. After the 11 September terrorist attacks, the existing analytic component in the Counterterrorism Center is significantly expanded and renamed the Office of Terrorism Analysis.
<br><br>
CIn response to the events of 11 September, DCI Tenet tasked the DDI to create a “red cell” that would think unconventionally about the full range of relevant analytic issues. The DCI Red Cell takes a pronounced “out-of-the-box” approach and produces memos intended to provoke thought rather than to provide authoritative assessment.
<br><br>
2002 C The DI celebrates its 50th anniversary.
<br><br>
CCIA University is created to equip all CIA officers with the shared values, commitment to mission, knowledge, and excellence in intelligence tradecraft and leadership needed to accomplish the extraordinary tasks in their service to our nation. CIAU links together all existing CIA training programs, such as the DI Sherman Kent School, into CIA's first corporate university, and creates new CIA-wide schools to provide integrated training for all CIA officers in Agency mission and tradecraft knowledge, leadership, and foreign languages.
<br><br>
2003 C The DI Collection Requirements and Evaluation Staff (CRES) is reorganized and renamed the Office of Collection Strategies and Analysis (CSAA) in April. A number of factors drove this realignment, foremost of which were gaining greater flexibility in supporting global coverage issues, increasing analytic resources against high-priority issues, and strengthening the Directorate’s ability to drive future collection programs.
<br><br>
CThe Office of Iraq Analysis is created in November to concentrate and expand the Directorate’s research and analysis effort on a major national security priority.
<br><br>
2004 C The 9/11 Commission Report is published in July, and provides recommendations on how to improve the collection, analysis, and organization of intelligence in light of lessons learned from the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States.
<br><br>
CIn August, a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is created to coordinate and monitor counterterrorism plans and activities of all government agencies and departments to ensure effective joint action based on all intelligence available to the US government. Numerous DI analysts are assigned to work in NCTC.
<br><br>
CThe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 becomes law in December and creates the position of Director of National Intelligence, or DNI, to coordinate and lead the entire Intelligence Community. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) loses this function, and now reports to the DNI, re-named as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, or DCIA.
<br><br>
2005 C The report of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, more commonly referred to as the WMD Commission is published. The report critiques the performance of the CIA and the Intelligence Community in their assessments of the presence of WMD in Iraq, and offers recommendations for improving intelligence performance, drawing upon lessons learned from this effort.
<br><br>

 





 
Training Resources
<br><br>


The Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis provides DI officers with an integrated, career-long program that combines specialized training in the craft of intelligence analysis with a substantive curriculum interwoven with the values, traditions, and history of the CIA. Courses on the intelligence profession along with instruction in foreign languages, regional studies, and core substantive issues enable DI officers to work in cross-component teams and to stay abreast of global and technological change. Leadership courses help officers explore and enhance their individual abilities and underscore the critical linkage between leadership, values, and the intelligence profession.
<br><br>
 The Sherman Kent School is the DI’s component of CIA University and provides basic analytic training and more advanced courses in specialized skills.<br><br>
--The Career Analyst Program (CAP) is the DI’s basic training program and introduces all new employees to the basic thinking, writing, and briefing skills needed for a successful career. Segments include analytic tools, counterintelligence issues, denial and deception analysis, and warning skills. <br><br>
--The Kent School also offers a wide range of intermediate- and advanced-level training for analysts and managers on analytic methodologies, substantive issues, and leadership skills. <br><br>
--This DI-specific curriculum is supplemented by courses offered in the CIA University’s Leadership and Mission Academies, which focus on broader leadership development issues and substantive training.<br><br>

Analysts can take advantage of part-time or evening course work at the multitude of excellent universities in the Washington, D.C. area. Full-time study options are available on a select basis through individual offices. Individuals also may compete for a study position at one of the military services programs, such as the National War College or the Army or Naval War College.<br><br>

Because language capability is an important part of the analyst’s toolkit, CIA University offers a range of full-time language training opportunities. In addition, the DI sponsors part-time courses in such languages as Arabic, Persian, Chinese, and Russian.<br><br>
 





 
Products<br><br>



The DI’s flagship product is its daily publication, the CIA World Intelligence Review (WIRe). The DI also contributes to the President’s Daily Brief (PDB), an Intelligence Community daily product, coordinated by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) staff. Because information in these two publications is extremely sensitive, they are highly classified and are provided only to a restricted readership. Both the WIRe and the PDB offer analysis that helps policy and security officials work through the core issues in the broader US policy agenda.<br><br>
--The WIRe is an electronic publication aimed at senior policy and security officials throughout the US Government.  Many items from the WIRe are available to major US military commands.<br><br>
--The PDB compiles the Intelligence Community’s highest level intelligence analysis targeted at the key national security issues and concerns of the President. The PDB is given only to the President, the Vice President, and a very select group of Cabinet-level officials designated by the President.<br><br>

In addition to preparing articles for the WIRe and the PDB, DI analysts frequently draft memos to respond to the specific questions of individual policymakers or to support upcoming meetings on key policy issues. Analysts also research their areas of specialty to anticipate future challenges, problems, and opportunities for US security interests, sharing their findings through classified publications and oral briefings.<br><br>

 The DI publishes unclassified reference aids that are available to the public. The annual World Factbook is a comprehensive compendium of profiles on more than 260 countries and other entities. Information on geographic, political, demographic, economic, and military issues is included. Chiefs of State and Cabinet Ministers of Foreign Governments is a directory of foreign government officials.<br><br>
Careers<br><br>



DI analysts have a variety of assignment options available and can take on a range of different challenges as part of their growth and development. All new analysts spend four months in the Career Analyst Program, where they receive a grounding in analytic tradecraft and methods. Some also can expect to spend part of their first two years serving a tour in the 24/7 Operations Center, the Agency’s nerve center.<br><br>

From there, analysts can consider a number of options to deepen their expertise as intelligence professionals―an overseas tour in an Embassy, an assignment on a different substantive area, or full-time language or academic training. Tailored developmental programs that combine academic study, travel, or in-depth research on a country or topic also are available on a competitive, limited basis. In addition, analysts may consider assignments that broaden their knowledge of the intelligence business, such as a tour in a different part of CIA or in another agency within the Intelligence Community.
<br><br>
As an individual becomes more skilled in analytic tradecraft and builds substantive depth, assignment options include working at a policy agency, such as State Department or the Department of Defense. Officers have many opportunities to stretch their skills in more corporate assignments, such as teaching at the Kent School, working as a President’s Daily Brief editor or serving as a briefer to senior policymakers. Broadening assignments elsewhere in CIA―such as a tour on the Inspector General’s staff or in the Office of Congressional Affairs―also are options for more seasoned analysts. In addition, senior officers can opt to serve as DI or D/CIA representatives in overseas postings or at military commands.
<br><br>
All analysts who choose a career in the Agency have the option of remaining in the analytical track or can choose a path that leads to management responsibilities. Both choices offer challenging opportunities and similar rewards in terms of advancement. There usually are aspects of most assignments that build skills for either track, and analysts can explore their interest and aptitude for management through training and assignment opportunities after their first few years in the organization.<br><br>

It's been said that the most important thing analysts with the CIA know ― even with all of their top secret information ― is that their work has a profound impact. The analysts who work in the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) are some of the brightest people in the country, but what truly makes their contributions outstanding is the integrity and objectivity they bring to it. They do this not to gain public accolades or recognition, but because the country and the President need experts who will tell it like it is. From the Cold War to the war on terrorism, the energy and commitment of the DI officer has been critical to our nation's security.
<br><br>
 


The Job of an Analyst<br><br>

Analysts are skilled subject-matter experts who study and evaluate information from many sources. Information flows in from around the world, including satellite surveillance, foreign newspapers and broadcasts, and human contacts. This information varies widely in terms of reliability, and often it is conflicting or incomplete. The analyst's role is to develop meaningful and usable intelligence assessments from all of those sources. Often this is like putting together the pieces of a puzzle, received at different times from different places, to form a picture that is complete enough to comprehend ― even when some pieces are still missing.
<br><br>
Analysts are grouped into the following categories of expertise:
<br><br>
-Analytic Methodologists develop and apply new or established approaches to analysis ― such as statistical, polling, econometric, mathematical, or geospatial modeling methodologies ― to add rigor and precision to the DI’s overall intelligence analysis and collection.
<br><br>

-Counterintelligence Threat Analysts collect, study, and interpret a range of reports to identify and prevent foreign intelligence operations that threaten the US Government or Intelligence Community.
<br><br>

-Counterterrorism Analysts help warn of terrorist threats by assessing the leadership, motivations, plans, and intentions of foreign terrorist groups and their state and nonstate sponsors.

<br><br>
-Crime and Counternarcotics Analysts follow international narcotics trafficking and organized crime groups to detect emerging trends and patterns that will affect US national security. 

<br><br>
-Economic Analysts use their specialized skills to analyze and interpret economic trends and developments, assess and track foreign financial activities, and develop new econometric and modeling methodologies.

<br><br>
-Intelligence Collection Analysts apply their expertise on intelligence collection systems capabilities, processes, and policies to drive the flow of intelligence information and provide colleagues the data needed to understand and analyze issues.
<br><br>
-Leadership Analysts collect and analyze information on foreign leaders and organizations to offer US policymakers insights on their foreign counterparts. 
<br><br>
-Medical and Health Analysts are physicians who analyze and assess global health issues, such as disease outbreaks, and who follow the health of foreign leaders.
<br><br>

-Military Analysts help US policymakers stay on top of threats by following foreign military and technical developments that affect another country’s ability to wage war or to threaten regional or international stability.
<br><br>

-Political Analysts look at political, social, cultural, and historical information to interpret intelligence about foreign political systems and developments.

<br><br>
-Psychological and Psychiatric Analysts tap their expertise in psychology, psychiatry, or sociology to study the health of foreign officials and to assess the psychological and social factors that influence world events.
<br><br>

-Science & Technology Analysts use their unique technical and scientific knowledge to identify and analyze weapons proliferation and proliferators; conventional weapons systems; chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons; information warfare; computer systems; and energy security.
<br><br>

-Targeting Analysts use network analysis techniques and specialized analytical tools to identify and detail key figures and organizations who may pose a threat to US interests.

<br><br>


The Role of Analysis
<br><br>
An intelligence analyst pulls together relevant information from all available sources and then analyzes it to produce timely and objective assessments, free of any political bias. This finished intelligence product, which may be in the form of a written report or oral briefings, could very well appear on the desks of the President and his key senior advisors.
<br><br>
Each morning, the Director of National Intelligence delivers the President's Daily Brief, an extremely sensitive intelligence document containing short assessments of current worldwide developments, as well as anticipated events that will require the President's attention in the future. The assessment content represents a team effort by analysts across the community .
<br><br>
To highlight the importance of analysis, consider a recent briefing on smallpox. One analyst's routine update, about the risk of naturally occurring smallpox outbreaks and the threat from countries that hold stores of the virus, took on new importance in light of other global events and virus outbreaks. That update was passed up and on, becoming a full Presidential briefing.

<br><br>

Is This the Job for You?
<br><br>
Intelligence analysts are on the cutting edge of fast-paced global change. To keep up, several qualities are critical for success: problem solving, strong communication skills and teamwork.

<br><br>Does the CIA spy on Americans?
<br><br>
By direction of the President in Executive Order 12333 of 1981 and in accordance with procedures approved by the Attorney General, the CIA is restricted in the collection of intelligence information directed against U.S. citizens. Collection is allowed only for an authorized intelligence purpose; for example, if there is a reason to believe that an individual is involved in espionage or international terrorist activities. The CIA's procedures require senior approval for any such collection that is allowed, and, depending on the collection technique employed, the sanction of the Director of National Intelligence and Attorney General may be required. These restrictions on the CIA have been in effect since the 1970s.

<br><br>Who decides when the CIA should participate in Covert Actions, and why?
<br><br>
Only the President can direct the CIA to undertake Covert Action. Such actions usually are recommended by the National Security Council (NSC) [external link disclaimer]. Intelligence oversight committees of the United States Congress provide oversight on all Covert Action activities.

<br><br>What is the CIA's role in combating international terrorism? 
<br><br>
The CIA supports the overall U.S. government effort to combat international terrorism by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence on foreign terrorist groups and individuals. The CIA also works with friendly foreign governments and shares pertinent information with them.

<br><br>Who oversees the CIA? Does it act on its own initiative?
<br><br>
Both the Congress and the Executive Branch oversee the CIA’s activities. In addition, the CIA is responsible to the American people through their elected representatives, and, like other government agencies, acts in accordance with U.S. laws and executive orders. In the Executive Branch, the National Security Council―including the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense―provides guidance and direction for national foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities. In Congress, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as other committees, closely monitor the Agency’s reporting and programs. The CIA is not a policy-making organization; it advises the Director of National Intelligence on matters of foreign intelligence, and it conducts Covert Actions only at the direction of the President.

<br><br>What if I want to eventually work for CIA? 
<br><br>
To qualify for a position with the Agency, you must be 18 years of age, a U.S. citizen, and a high school graduate. Our personnel requirements change from month-to-month as positions are filled and others become available. A college degree, preferably an advanced degree, is a standard requirement for overseas Officers, Intelligence Analysts, and other Non-Clerical positions. Knowledge of a foreign language is also helpful. Because the Agency's personnel needs span such a broad spectrum, we do not recommend any one academic track over another.

Mike, Senior Project Manager, 34 years with the CIA<br><br>
"It is exciting to work in an environment where technology and technology management intersect, and where the result is a mature set of practices for the management of our diverse projects.
<br><br>

Bob, Technical Analyst Manager, 10 years with the CIA<br><br>
"As a liberal arts major, I may be in the minority in the DS&T, but we draw part of our strength and agility from our diversity of skills and knowledge and talents. I can attest that creativity, ingenuity, and determination are valued and rewarded as much as technical skill and expert knowledge. I honestly feel like I'm part of something truly special here, that my contribution is unique, and that my work matters. Even after more than 10 years at CIA, when I take a second to reflect on the things we do in the DS&T across the board on a daily basis, the same word always comes to mind--whoa."

Amy, DS&T Liaison to the Office of Congressional Affairs, 20 years with the CIA<br><br>
"How did an English major from Duke University end up spending 20+ years working science and technology in CIA? Aside from serendipity and sheer good fortune, it's because what we do on a day-to-day basis really does contribute to the security and well-being of our country -- our families, our friends and neighbors, and our fellow citizens. You can and will see the results of your hard work and that of your colleagues. And it is a career that never goes stale. You can reimagine your goals -- and reinvent your professional identity -- several times over, all with the organization's encouragement and support. The Directorate of Science & Technology goes where life takes you." <br><br>


Linda, Engineer, 9 months with the CIA<br><br>
"On September 11, 2001, I was working with a telecommunications company near Dulles Airport.  After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon that morning, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all planes to land at the nearest airport. I watched from my office building as plane after plane landed safely at Dulles. My desire to help prevent this type of terrorist act from happening again was intense. I wanted to make a difference in the defense of this nation and decided to apply to the CIA. Today, as an engineer in the DS&T, I clearly can see how my role is tied to the counter terrorist mission. In my office, we build space systems. It takes a long time to design and deploy a new satellite, but it's very motivating to know that you are part of the team responsible for each new launch and for the positive reports of finding the enemy.  For me, the ability to support our nation's fight against terrorism is awesome!"

The People of the CIA … DS&T Officers: Using Science to Achieve the Mission
<br><br>


In the movies, secret agents have a team of scientists they go to for gadgets to use during the mission, such as the “Q Branch” in James Bond movies. The Central Intelligence Agency has a similar branch, but it is only a very small part of the Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T). The DS&T is made up of scientists, engineers, and others with different specialties who leverage technical expertise and tradecraft to provide integrated solutions to national intelligence problems.<br><br>

Katie, Rachel and Joshua aren’t part of the “Q Branch,” but their creativity and resourcefulness would make James Bond proud. These three talented CIA DS&T Technical Intelligence Officers use science every day to contribute to the CIA mission.<br><br>

 

Technology and the Mission<br><br>

Katie uses her engineering expertise to develop tools that locate terrorists. Rachel creates concealment devices for National Clandestine Service officers’ mission needs. Joshua looks for new approaches to solving critical technical gaps. His work includes reaching back to academia for the latest in scientific and technical advancements to apply to Agency needs.<br><br>

At the end of the day, Katie, Rachel and Joshua know that their work has made an impact on national security.<br><br>

“It’s amazing to see how a small project that I’ve worked on has developed and contributed to the mission,” Katie said. “Sometimes I will see or hear a reference to something that I’ve worked on in the news.”
<br><br>
“Concealments are vital to the Agency mission,” Rachel said. “Operations couldn’t be completed without the unique technical solutions that we produce.”<br><br>

“In academic research, you work on a small piece of a bigger project and may never get to see the big picture,” Joshua said. “I get to see how the latest advancements in science are having an impact on national security.”
<br><br>
 

Dream Job<br><br>

Before Katie, Rachel and Joshua were changing the world with science, they did not even know that the CIA had a need for scientists and engineers. They never even imagined having the opportunity to work for the Agency.<br><br>

As a college student, Katie had a lot of internship opportunities. While she was successful and learned a lot during these internships, she never really felt her work was making much of an impact. Finally, she applied to intern at the CIA.
<br><br>
“When I got here and started working, I realized that it was the perfect fit for me,” she said.<br><br>

After Katie graduated, she was hired by the Agency and began work in 2008.<br><br>

Rachel was making her way through a career fair sponsored by her school when she saw that the CIA had a booth with a representative who was making appointments for interviews.<br><br>

“I went over to the booth and talked to the representative until I was asked to interview,” Rachel said. “I thought it would be an amazing opportunity to work someplace where I could actually have an impact on the world.”<br><br>

Rachel got into the Agency’s co-op program in college and was hired after she graduated. She began working for the Agency in 2008.<br><br>

Joshua was seeking challenges beyond the world of academia. After graduating with a degree in molecular biology, he planned to teach and run a lab at a university. However, it’s very competitive to get a professor’s position. At the suggestion of a classmate, Joshua applied to the CIA. Even though Joshua was born outside of the United States, he obtained a full CIA security clearance. He came to work at the Agency in 2008.
<br><br>
 

Working at the Agency<br><br>

The first day of work is an exciting and eye-opening experience for an Agency employee.
<br><br>
“I remember sitting in the lobby near the Agency seal and thinking, ‘I can’t believe I’m here. This is like something out of a movie,’” Rachel said.<br><br>

“I really enjoyed hearing stories from senior Agency employees,” Katie said. “It was clear that they loved their careers, were passionate about their work, and proud to play a role in the Agency’s mission.”
<br><br>
It’s common for new employees to have misconceptions about the Agency. These are often dispelled during the first week of work.<br><br>

“I thought my office would have a very formal atmosphere: men in black suits and clipped, whispered conversations in the hallway,” Rachel said. “It’s nothing like that. We’re very casual here because we work in a lab and get messy.”
<br><br>
Others have no idea what to expect.<br><br>

“Up until my first day at work, the only exposure I had to the CIA was in the movies,” Katie said. “I realized that there’s a balance between the real world and movie portrayals.”<br><br>

“I had no idea just how large an organization the Agency is,” Joshua said. “I also wasn’t sure what the Agency did and why they would need scientists.”
<br><br>
 

Amazing Experiences<br><br>

Katie, Rachel and Joshua cannot say enough good things about their time at the Agency.
<br><br>
“My job is what little kids dream about,” Rachel said. “We can build anything. I’ve seen things that I did not think were possible.”<br><br>

“I have the coolest job in the world,” Katie said. “It combines biology, chemistry, optics and acoustics. I’m getting to do things I never thought I would.”
<br><br>
“I look forward to working overseas someday and applying my expertise there,” said Joshua.
<br><br>
In addition to their great work experiences, all of them spoke of the unique travel, training, and mentoring opportunities available to them as CIA officers.
<br><br>
“The travel opportunities I've had were eye opening,” Katie said. “I’ve been able to go places that I wouldn’t necessarily go on vacation. I’m seeing the world as it truly is instead of how the tourism industry portrays it.”
<br><br>
“The mentors are really wonderful about helping with projects,” Rachel said. “They’ll walk through the lab and ask what you’re working on and offer some help and guidance. You don’t have to be scared to ask them for help.”
<br><br>
“I've had the opportunity to travel, interact in the academic arena familiar to me, and see what's on the forefront of technology,” Joshua said.
<br><br>
 

Words of Wisdom

Careers


<br><br>
Be a Part of a Worldwide Technical Team
<br><br>
If the United States is to maintain its strategic advantage over its adversaries, it is more critical than ever for the DS&T to have a workforce with a diverse and technically savvy skill set.  Keeping pace with rapidly evolving information technologies represents one of our greatest challenges. While new technologies are changing the way our targets use their information, we, too, must be wary and protect our information and systems against attacks by hostile intelligence services and hackers. Sophisticated defenses and emerging threats continue to raise the bar for our need of expert engineers, scientists, analysts, and commercial artists.
<br><br>
It is imperative that we employ the best and the brightest minds to ensure our success in fulfilling the Agency's foreign intelligence mission. Successfully grasping and integrating emerging technologies into our operations requires us to recruit and retain the right technical skills to defeat increasingly complex technologies.
<br><br>
Our mission is fascinating. <br><br>
There are opportunities at the CIA that are not available in the private sector. We often are tasked with developing one-of-a-kind, limited production items to meet national security requirements. Our engineers and scientists work with the most advanced technologies and interact regularly with top specialists in academia, industry, and government.
<br><br>
We operate worldwide. <br><br>
Travel opportunities and overseas assignments are common. The DS&T also provides new employees a large scope of responsibility, allowing our officers to make a positive contribution to safeguarding the nation's security early on in their careers.<br><br>

We have the people with the ability and desire to make what is impossible today happen tomorrow, but we always need new talent and value fresh perspectives. If you are interested in being a part of our DS&T team, visit the CIA Careers page.

	<hr><br>
	
In CIA's unique environment, support to our intelligence collectors and to our analysts must be focused, agile, integrated, and 100 percent reliable.<br><br>

The Directorate of Support (DS) provides everything the CIA needs to accomplish its critical mission of defending our nation. Serving side-by-side with our mission colleagues from the Directorate of Intelligence, the Directorate of Science & Technology, and the National Clandestine Service, our job is to ensure that all our mission elements have everything they need for success.<br><br>

DS officers are often among the first CIA officers into difficult operational areas. We are responsible for getting key support functions ― to include security, supply chains, facilities, financial and medical services and others ― up and running. We are present throughout operations, providing ongoing support for each mission component. And, at the end of the operation, we ensure that people and equipment get out safely. This "first in, last out" support must often be performed clandestinely, with our hand unseen. But while the support we provide may be invisible ― the results certainly are not!<br><br>

We invite you to explore the many employment opportunities available to you, both within the Agency and across the Intelligence Community, as a vital member of our extraordinary team.

History
<br><br>


Mission support was integral to CIA’s activities even before the official founding of the Agency in 1947. Organizational alignment has evolved with the challenges of specific eras, but the basic support disciplines have remained the same:<br><br>
-personnel resources <br><br>
-logistics <br><br>
-finance <br><br>
-facilities <br><br>
-acquisitions <br><br>
-security <br><br>
-medical services <br><br>
-general support management<br><br>

 

Support functions were initially carried out under the purview of an Executive for Administration and Management. In 1950, offices for Administration and Personnel were established. Beginning in the 1950s, CIA support officers were forward-deployed with analysts, scientists, engineers and clandestine service officers, a tradition that continues to this day.<br><br>

During the 1990s, various support offices underwent changes in the way they do business. Support functions were administratively dispersed across the Agency. Selected support activities adopted a cost-recovery model, charging mission partners for services, mirroring their commercial counterparts.
<br><br>
In response to accelerated post-9/11 national security needs, the majority of business lines were reunited under one governance structure with an emphasis on integration, agility, and global capabilities. Recent structural adjustments continue to improve customer service.
<br><br>

Life in HR: Learning Resources

<br><br>

Learning and professional growth are key to a career at the CIA. Following initial orientation, new employees can expect to invest considerable time learning the skills needed to perform their jobs. They continue acquiring new skills and knowledge as the world changes and their careers progress. The CIA also sponsors employee participation in professional conferences, academic courses, and vendor-taught workshops.
<br><br>
CIA University, the learning hub of the CIA, equips employees with the shared values, commitment to the mission, knowledge, and the excellence in intelligence tradecraft and leadership needed to accomplish extraordinary tasks in service to our nation. The schools under CIAU, partnered with the broader National Intelligence University, provide a wide variety of training and educational opportunities in which CIA officers develop new ways to frame the world in support of national security initiatives.
<br><br>
Course offerings evolve as threats and challenges in the world emerge and change. Today there are classes focused on the terrorist threat, critical regions of the world, weapons of mass destruction, foreign language training, and proliferation to name just a few. These classes take place in tandem with classes on more general topics such as information technology, project management, the Intelligence Community, and communication skills.
<br><br>
CIA employees deployed to the field benefit from traditional classroom instruction as well as cutting-edge, online, and mobile learning technologies. An officer serving abroad may find himself/herself in a video teleconference for training on a new financial management tool, engaging in an interactive online course on biological weapons, or listening to a foreign language podcast to improve language skills. As employees advance and take on greater responsibility, they have access to world-class management and advanced leadership training in key occupational and substantive areas often sitting side-by-side with their counterparts from other Intelligence Community agencies.
<br><br>
The world of intelligence is increasingly complex, making continuous learning an imperative. A robust set of thought provoking and engaging educational opportunities are available to meet the need, all specially designed to position CIA employees for mission success.

<br><br>
Performance Evaluation
<br><br>What is the performance evaluation process for CIA employees?
<br><br>
All CIA employees participate in a robust performance management program. The program empowers employees to be actively involved in the development of performance objectives, to discuss progress throughout the evaluation period with their managers, and concludes with written performance narratives. Employees are required to be evaluated annually and are consideration for promotion as competencies are demonstrated.

Life in HR: Learning Resources<br><br>



Learning and professional growth are key to a career at the CIA. Following initial orientation, new employees can expect to invest considerable time learning the skills needed to perform their jobs. They continue acquiring new skills and knowledge as the world changes and their careers progress. The CIA also sponsors employee participation in professional conferences, academic courses, and vendor-taught workshops.<br><br>

CIA University, the learning hub of the CIA, equips employees with the shared values, commitment to the mission, knowledge, and the excellence in intelligence tradecraft and leadership needed to accomplish extraordinary tasks in service to our nation. The schools under CIAU, partnered with the broader National Intelligence University, provide a wide variety of training and educational opportunities in which CIA officers develop new ways to frame the world in support of national security initiatives.<br><br>

Course offerings evolve as threats and challenges in the world emerge and change. Today there are classes focused on the terrorist threat, critical regions of the world, weapons of mass destruction, foreign language training, and proliferation to name just a few. These classes take place in tandem with classes on more general topics such as information technology, project management, the Intelligence Community, and communication skills.<br><br>

CIA employees deployed to the field benefit from traditional classroom instruction as well as cutting-edge, online, and mobile learning technologies. An officer serving abroad may find himself/herself in a video teleconference for training on a new financial management tool, engaging in an interactive online course on biological weapons, or listening to a foreign language podcast to improve language skills. As employees advance and take on greater responsibility, they have access to world-class management and advanced leadership training in key occupational and substantive areas often sitting side-by-side with their counterparts from other Intelligence Community agencies.<br><br>

The world of intelligence is increasingly complex, making continuous learning an imperative. A robust set of thought provoking and engaging educational opportunities are available to meet the need, all specially designed to position CIA employees for mission success.<br><br>



Entertainment Industry Liaison联络人<br><br>



As an organization that plays a key role in America’s defense, the CIA is a frequent subject of books, motion pictures, documentaries, and other creative ventures. For years, artists from across the entertainment industry ― actors, authors, directors, producers, screenwriters, and others ― have been in touch with the CIA to gain a better understanding of our intelligence mission. Our goal is an accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA, and the skill, innovation, daring, and commitment to public service that defines them.
<br><br>
If you are part of the entertainment industry, and are working on a project that deals with the CIA, the Agency may be able to help you. We are in a position to give greater authenticity to scripts, stories, and other products in development. That can mean answering questions, debunking myths, or arranging visits to the CIA to meet the people who know intelligence ― its past, present, and future. In some cases, we permit filming on our headquarters compound. (Please visit our Headquarters Virtual Tour.)  We can also provide stock footage of locations within and around our main building.
<br><br>
Intelligence is challenging, exciting, and essential. To better convey that reality, the CIA is ready for a constructive dialogue with a broad range of creative talents.

	<b><a name="T13">General Counsel</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The General Counsel is the chief legal officer of the CIA. The General Counsel serves as the legal advisor to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and is responsible for the sound and efficient management of the legal affairs of the CIA. The General Counsel is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, a requirement added in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997.
<br><br>
The CIA Office of General Counsel (OGC) is an independent office of the CIA that is headed by the General Counsel and assists the General Counsel in carrying out his statutory and other responsibilities. On behalf of the General Counsel, OGC provides legal advice and guidance to the Agency and to the Director of the CIA. OGC is responsible for advising the Director on all legal matters relating to his statutory responsibilities and his role as head of the CIA. OGC also provides advice and guidance to those officers and employees within the CIA who have specific responsibility for the conduct of US intelligence activities.
 
<br><br>




 
Who We Are<br><br>



OGC's Attorneys<br><br>

The Office of General Counsel consists of attorneys with a variety of backgrounds and experience. Here is what a few of them have to say about OGC:<br><br>

"Leaving an AmLaw 100 firm to come to CIA was the best career move I've made. Here, I've found the interesting work and the smart and dedicated colleagues that I'd come to expect at a big firm -- but I have also discovered the joys of practicing law without billable hours and in an environment where commitments to family and other outside activities are both respected and encouraged." -- A lateral CIA attorney
<br><br>
"I came to OGC after 10 years as in-house counsel to a small nonprofit and could not be happier with my decision. One of the most appealing aspects of working in OGC is that you are constantly learning something new. Between the opportunities for job change, the support for ongoing education, and the collegial environment in which attorneys share ideas and opinions, OGC is an incredibly dynamic place to work." -- A lateral CIA attorney
<br><br>
"Starting in OGC as a Summer Law Clerk, growing as an attorney through the Honors Program, and continuing a career here has given me wonderful opportunities. In my opinion, the best part of working in OGC is the variety of jobs you can have, without changing employers. I have had a chance to serve two rotational assignments outside of CIA -- one with the Air Force and a second as a Trial Attorney in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, gaining valuable experience and insight into areas outside of the Intelligence Community. The flexibility of the office, and the number of creative assignments available, is different from nearly every other legal sector job. The challenge, the variety, and the potential to learn new areas of law means every day is different and the experience is rewarding in very diverse ways." -- A current CIA attorney<br><br>

"I joined the Agency as a Summer Law Clerk. Through the Summer Law Clerk program, I gained exposure to the Agency's wide-ranging legal practice and learned a lot about the Agency and the Intelligence Community. After finishing law school, I returned to the Agency through the Honors Program. As an Honors Attorney, I interact daily with clients and provide guidance on a variety of interesting legal issues. The legal issues that arise here are often similar to issues that would arise elsewhere, but they always have an Agency-unique twist that makes practicing law here challenging and interesting." -- A CIA Honors attorney<br><br>






 
What We Do<br><br>



Organization<br><br>

All members of Office of General Counsel (OGC) report to the General Counsel either directly or through senior OGC attorneys who report to the General Counsel. OGC provides legal advice and guidance to senior Agency management and to individual Agency components through OGC's main divisions and attorneys who sit with their clients.

 <br><br>

Areas of Practice<br><br>

Among other things, OGC handles legal issues relating to foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities, international terrorism, international narcotics trafficking, nonproliferation, personnel and security matters, contracting, finance and budget matters, legislation, and both civil and criminal litigation.
<br><br>
OGC's legal practice areas include: administrative law and government ethics, intelligence support, litigation, operational law, logistics and procurement law, real estate law, environmental law, legislative affairs, law enforcement assistance, information law, security law, personnel law, appropriations and finance law, legal support to the intelligence analysis process, and legal support to science and technology activities.
History of the Office<br><br>



The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has always had a chief legal officer who played a major role in support of the mission of the CIA. The position of General Counsel was established within the CIA in 1947, the same year that President Truman signed into law the National Security Act that created the CIA. The first CIA General Counsel was Lawrence R. Houston, who had served as Assistant General Counsel of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS); General Counsel of its War Department successor organization, the Strategic Services Unit; and General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG). Houston was a principal draftsman of the legislative proposal to abolish the CIG and establish the CIA, which was incorporated into the legislation that became the National Security Act.
<br><br>
When the CIG was abolished by the National Security Act of 1947, all CIG personnel were transferred by law to the newly established CIA, where Houston continued to serve as General Counsel. Within the next three years, two other attorneys, Walter Pforzheimer and John S. Warner, joined Houston as Assistant General Counsels. Together all three attorneys helped to draft the legislation that became the CIA Act of 1949, which gave CIA special statutory authorities unique within the federal government.<br><br>
In 1953, the Office of General Counsel was formally established. Over the years, the OGC has varied in size, generally growing as the law affecting CIA has become more extensive and increasingly complex. During this time, OGC resided in different parts of the CIA, including within the former Directorate of Administration, and now is an independent office under the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (formerly the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI)).
<br><br>
In 1976, the Office began to hire a greater number of staff attorneys from outside the CIA, and the DCI appointed the first General Counsel from outside the CIA, Anthony A. Lapham.  More recently, in 1996, a statute was enacted requiring the General Counsel to be appointed by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent of the Senate.
<br><br>
Today, OGC has approximately 100 attorneys, who are involved in providing counsel on a wide range of CIA activities, such as clandestine collection, counterintelligence, covert action, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, counternarcotics, as well as many others. OGC attorneys are complemented by a strong support structure composed of special assistants, administrative assistants, paralegals, a central registry, an information management staff, a librarian, and an administration staff, that together continue to provide CIA with dedicated and professional legal representation in the tradition of Lawrence Houston.

	<b><a name="T14">Inspector General</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Created in 1989, the statutory Inspector General (IG) is responsible for independent oversight of the CIA.  The IG is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and may only be removed from office by the president.  The IG’s authorities and responsibilities are provided in 50 U.S.C. §3517.  Although the IG reports to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the statute creates obligations and responsibilities to both the Director and to the Congress.
<br><br>
The CIA Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent office of the CIA that is headed by the Inspector General and promotes economy, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability in the management of CIA activities by performing independent audits, inspections, investigations, and reviews of CIA programs and operations.  The OIG also seeks to detect and deter fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement.  The OIG advances the Agency’s mission by providing findings and recommendations expeditiously to the Director, the Agency and the Congressional intelligence committees.  The OIG works directly with the Department of Justice and other appropriate federal agencies when investigating alleged violations of law.<br><br>
Who We Are<br><br>



To meets its mission, the CIA Office of Inspector General (OIG) is organized into three operational staffs:
<br><br>
The Audit Staff is composed of professionally trained auditors who undertake performance and financial audits of CIA programs and activities in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.<br><br>
--Performance audits review issues of efficiency and effectiveness, as well as compliance with laws and regulations.<br><br>
--Financial audits review the integrity of financial transactions and statements and assess the adherence to generally accepted government accounting standards.
<br><br>
 

The Inspection Staff is composed of senior officers on two-year rotations from other CIA components and conducts two broad types of inspections:<br><br>
--Component inspections assess the efficiency and effectiveness of office-level components, addressing areas such as mission accomplishment, management performance, and utilization of resources.<br><br>
--Issue inspections address topics that usually cut across directorate lines and affect broad segments of the CIA.
<br><br>
 

The Investigations Staff is composed of professionally trained investigators who investigate allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or other wrongdoing brought to the attention of the IG.<br><br>
History<br><br>



The CIA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) had its origin in the Central Intelligence Group, but the position of Inspector General (IG) more closely related to the one we know today was established on 1 January 1952. By March 1953, the OIG mission was defined, and the IG was charged with conducting investigations throughout the Agency on behalf of the then Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and with inspecting the performance of missions and exercise of functions of all CIA offices and personnel. In May 1962, the positions of Chief of the Inspection Staff and Chief of the Audit Staff were established, although the former was often handled as a concurrent duty of the Deputy IG. The Investigations Staff was originally established as the OIG's Grievance Group in November 1977.
<br><br>
 Scrutiny and Oversight: In 1975, the Rockefeller Commission found that the IG's role had varied depending on the differing styles and management approaches of each DCI. In 1976, the Church and Pike Committees were critical of the OIG, citing a lack of objectivity and insufficient authority and independence. In November 1987, almost 10 years later, the Congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair concluded in their final report that the OIG "appears not to have had the manpower, resources, or tenacity to acquire key facts uncovered by the other investigations of the Iran-Contra affair." The shortcomings were attributed, in part, to the institutional limitations on the OIG as it was then operating, e.g., the same people overseeing and conducting the inspections and investigations, to include the IG and his deputy, would often return for onward career assignments to the components they had inspected or investigated. The committees believed that the creation of an independent, statutory IG would improve the effectiveness and objectivity of the office. Indeed, independence and objectivity were identified as critical elements by all who scrutinized the OIG over the years.<br><br>


 The Statutory Inspector General was created in November 1989. In its report on the legislation that created the statutory IG for CIA, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said the purpose was to improve the office's status within the Agency; to enhance its autonomy and capabilities, thereby improving the objectivity and effectiveness of its performance; and to improve congressional oversight of the CIA's activities.  The IG is required by law to:
--Conduct, supervise, and coordinate―independently―audits, inspections, and investigations, relating to the programs and operations of the CIA to ensure that such programs and operations are conducted efficiently and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.<br><br>
--Keep the Director of the CIA (D/CIA) fully and currently informed concerning violations of law and regulations, fraud, and other serious problems, abuses, and deficiencies that may occur in CIA programs and operations, and to report the progress made in implementing corrective action.<br><br>
--Take due regard for the protection of intelligence sources and methods in the preparation of IG reports.<br><br>
--Provide a semiannual report to the D/CIA summarizing the activities of the OIG during the immediately preceding six-month period, which the D/CIA is required to submit to the congressional intelligence committees within 30 days.<br><br>
--Report immediately to the D/CIA any particularly serious or flagrant abuses, problems, or deficiencies relating to the administration of CIA programs or operations.  The D/CIA is then required to transmit such reports to the intelligence committees within seven days.<br><br>

Who We Are<br><br>



Our Vision<br><br>
--Ready: Resourced and trained to support the mission <br><br>
--Relevant: Value added to both the CIA and DoD<br><br>
--Responsive: Able to support emerging requirements anytime/anywhere under the most austere conditions
<br><br>
 

Core Values<br><br>

ADMA mirrors those values established by the Director of the CIA:<br><br>
--Service: We put country first and Agency before self.  Quiet patriotism is our hallmark.  We are dedicated to the mission, and we pride ourselves on our extraordinary responsiveness to the needs of our customers.<br><br>
--Integrity: We uphold the highest standards of conduct.  We seek and speak the truth to our colleagues and customers.  We honor those Agency officers and military detailees who have come before us and the colleagues with whom we work today.<br><br>
--Excellence: We hold ourselves and each other to the highest standards.  We embrace personal accountability.  We reflect on our performance and learn from that reflection.
 <br><br>





 
What We Do<br><br>



Critical Engagement Group<br><br>

ADMA's Critical Engagement Group is focused on direct interaction with members of our armed forces. We reach out to military units preparing for deployment, meeting with their leadership to explain CIA's capabilities. We discuss the CIA/military relationship during scheduled courses at schools run by the individual DoD components. We participate as a full partner in established military exercises conducted worldwide, and when necessary we team up with a deploying unit to facilitate on-the-spot operational coordination and deconfliction.
<br><br>
 

Command and Coordination Group<br><br>

ADMA’s Command and Coordination Group (CCG) provides support to major military command headquarters and combatant commands. CCG’s mission is emblematic of the ADMA motto “One Team, One Fight.”
<br><br>
 

Visitor Support Team<br><br>

ADMA’s Visitor Support Team plans, coordinates and supports numerous DoD visits to CIA each year. The Visitor Support Team helps educate military personnel about CIA roles, missions, and capabilities by arranging CIA briefings and tours. These visits are critical for both shorter-term specific, substantive issues of joint interest to CIA/DoD, as well as for longer-term staff development to build enduring relationships, facilitate communication and increase knowledge within DoD of CIA capabilities.<br><br>
 





 
History<br><br>



The CIA and the DoD have worked together since 1947 to help protect and defend the United States of America and our Constitution. This complex relationship has actively evolved over the decades in response to world events.
<br><br>
Given the lessons learned regarding intelligence support during Desert Shield/Storm, CIA established the Office of Military Affairs (OMA) to serve as the DoD’s formal entryway into CIA for support, information, and deconfliction of various issues. Concurrent with the creation of OMA, a senior military advisor position was established in the office of the Director of Operations (DO), the Associate Deputy Director of Operations for Military Affairs (ADDO/MA). Subsequently, this position was elevated to the DCIA’s staff as the Associate DCI for Military Support (ADCI/MS) with a focus on support to the Director of Central Intelligence.<br><br>

After the 9/11 attacks against the United States, a review group recommended merging ADCI/MS and OMA into one office, and CIA formally established the joined elements under the Associate Director for Military Affairs (ADMA) in 2007. Today, ADMA is jointly manned by Agency and uniformed military professionals, operating as one team to coordinate, plan, execute, and sustain joint CIA and DoD worldwide activities based upon priorities established by the Director of the CIA, to achieve National Security objectives.<br><br>
