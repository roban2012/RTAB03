CURRICULAR RENEWAL IN HARVARD COLLEGE<br><br>
LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS（第27条）<br><br>

27. The Committee reaffirms Harvard’s long-standing requirement that students complete a course dedicated to effective writing in the first year. We also support the current requirement that all students demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language. However, in order to provide first-year students with more flexibility, we will no longer expect that the language requirement be met in the freshman year. Rather, we ecommend that the language requirement be fulfilled by the end of the second year. Further, we believe that all Harvard College students should be expected to participate in a significant international experience.<br><br>

北大外国语学院院长程朝翔：美国哈佛大学2004年的本科评估报告，也是当时同文馆的思路：在全球化时代的本科教育中，要大力强化外语和科学教育。<br><br>
北大外国语言文学学科的建制屡有变迁。这一变迁的历史，对我们启示良多。清政府设立京师同文馆，是为了应对时代的挑战，培养西学人才。所以，除了外文类课程外，同文馆还逐渐设置了大量的科学课程。有趣的是，美国哈佛大学2004年的本科评估报告，也是当时同文馆的思路：在全球化时代的本科教育中，要大力强化外语和科学教育。<br><br>

Too Many Kids Quit Science Because They Don't Think They're Smart	<br><br>
But praising their intelligence can make them feel even more insecure. A self-esteem expert offers a way out of the conundrum. 	<br><br>
Alexandra Ossola  Nov 3 2014, 	<br><br>
For most students, science, math, engineering, and technology (STEM) subjects are not intuitive or easy. Learning in general―and STEM in particular―requires repeated trial and error, and a student’s lack of confidence can sometimes stand in her own way. And although teachers and parents may think they are doing otherwise, these adults inadvertently help kids make up their minds early on that they're not natural scientists or “math people,” which leads them to pursue other subjects instead.	<br><br>
So what's the best way to help kids feel confident enough to stay the STEM course? To answer this question, I spoke with Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford University in California. Over the past 20 years, Dweck has conducted dozens of studies about praise’s impact on students’ self-esteem and academic achievement. Here is a transcript of our conversation, which has been condensed and lightly edited.	<br><br>
Alexandra Ossola: What sparked your interest in this field?	<br><br>
Carol Dweck: We undertook this research at the height of the self-esteem movement, when the gurus were telling parents and teachers to praise kids to the hills, to tell them how talented, intelligent, brilliant they were. And this was supposed to boost their confidence and set them up for a successful life. And I thought, I don’t think so. When students thought of their intelligence as a thing that’s just fixed, they were vulnerable. They were not willing to take on challenges that might test their intelligence, and they weren’t resilient when they came into obstacles. Would children want to take on challenging things if they think that’s their claim to fame? It would discredit this valuable, permanent quality.	<br><br>
Ossola: What is a mistake that parents and teachers often make when it comes to praising kids?	<br><br>
Dweck: They often praise the ability, the talent, or the intelligence too much. The opposite of this is the good process praise. This is praise for the process the child engages in―their hard work, trying many strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their use of errors to learn, their improvement.	<br><br>
We conducted a study where we recorded videotapes of mothers interacting with babies when they were one, two, and three years old. The more the mothers gave process praise, the more their kids had a growth mindset and a desire for challenge five years later. And now we’re finding how much better those kids are achieving even two years after that.	<br><br>
Gender is relevant: The mothers are giving boys more process praise than they’re giving girls. Years ago we found the same thing in teachers giving feedback.	<br><br>
It’s not that they’re necessarily favoring boys. Even as infants, girls are more socially tuned in, easier to engage, and more able to maintain an interaction. This means that parents may have to work harder to engage boys and keep them engaged in a mutual activity. Parents’ harder work could take the form of more process praise―more narrating and commenting on what the boy is doing, more praise for the strategies they boy is trying, and more praise for attention and persistence.	<br><br>
It’s easy to get a girl to focus on you, and adults react to that. I’m not saying there aren’t stereotypes of girls that aren’t coming in. But this difference could really begin in a seemingly irrelevant biological difference between boys and girls that draws more process focus in parents and teachers, plus teaches boys a good lesson: when you pay attention and work hard, you do better. With girls, who are just self regulating away, they don’t need to give us those lessons. But as a result they think that when adults give them criticism, it’s for something really important. It’s about their ability, how good they are at something.	<br><br>
Ossola: What is the right balance of praise? How much is too much?	<br><br>
Dweck: That hasn’t been as well researched as what to praise. But we did some work, which we haven’t published, and we found that when we gave kids lots and lots of praise then discontinued it, they either lost motivation or they did a variety of strange and distorted things to get the adults’ approval back. There is such a thing as too much praise, we believe. When you praise someone, you are making their actions and performance yours. So they’re looking over their shoulder and not owning their work.	<br><br>
When you praise someone, you are making their actions and performance yours. So they’re looking over their shoulder.	<br><br>
Ossola: Does praise affect people at different places in their academic lives? Can it carry on into adulthood?	<br><br>
Dweck: It can be powerful at any age. Being a good parent has become synonymous with giving out ability praise. Parents still think this is the greatest gift they can give to their children, and as a child gets more and more insecure, they give more and more of it. And, by the way, a lot of employers and coaches have said, “My employees cannot get through the day without accolades and validation.” Even professional coaches have said they cannot give feedback without these people feeling that they’ve crushed them. We’ve created several generations now of very fragile individuals because they’ve been praised and hyped. And feel that anything but praise is devastating. 	<br><br>
Ossola: How can parents and educators foster this resilience to obstacles in other ways?	<br><br>
Dweck: Actually, praise may not be the optimal way, but we are so praise oriented. We can ask the child questions about the process: “How did you do that? Tell me about it.” As they talk about the process and the strategies they tried, we can appreciate it. We can be interested in it. We can encourage it. It doesn’t have to be outright praise.	<br><br>
Turning 3-Year-Olds Into Scientists	<br><br>
They may not be doing algebra, but pre-K kids can master scientific concepts that will make a big difference later on.  Alexandra Ossola Nov 5 2014	<br><br>
Anyone who has spent time with 3- or 4-year-olds knows it can be exhausting. They’re talkative, mobile, and independent, with a penchant for asking questions about everything. But well-structured pre-kindergarten classrooms are designed to harness that unbridled energy into enthusiasm learning. Colorful posters on the walls and stations set up for small group work ensure that kids are engaged in the new concepts and skills they learn.	<br><br>
By the time they set foot in a pre-K classroom, kids have been learning math and science for years. But for many students, this is the first time this learning is structured, where they start attaching names to these concepts in order to better articulate them. Research has shown that this is a critical age for children’s cognitive development; their education at this point lays the foundation for their future academic performance and beyond. Adults can foster this growth by helping to link the more intuitive elements with the way we communicate them, and conveying positive attitudes about math and science.	<br><br>
“Children’s cognitive abilities at the beginning of kindergarten are pretty strong predictors of their academic growth all the way through high school,” said Michele Mazzocco, a professor of child development at the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Research over the past few decades has connected early childhood education with later academic and even professional success. Part of the reason this stage is so important, according to developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, is that children ages 2 through 7 are in the symbolic function stage of their development. Although not all of his theories were correct, his assessment of period has persisted for almost a century: Children in the symbolic function stage start to connect physical objects to abstract concepts, shaped by instruction in how to communicate these connections as well as the children’s own experience.	<br><br>
When they enter pre-K, children are already thinking about science in the form of cause-and-effect relationships, Mazzocco said. If they do x, then y will happen―the universe has an order and a logic to it. Kids also begin exploring early math and science concepts by observing comparing objects. They’re intuitively drawn to quantities, patterns, shapes, rhythms, symmetry, ratios―“A lot of the informal aspects of math that appear intuitive,” Mazzocco said. Kids are really good at spatial reasoning, she added; they appreciate the ratios and patterns when building with blocks like Legos. These ideas are not as complex as the theory of relativity, obviously. But these concepts that connect the tangible to the abstract lay the foundation for scientific and mathematical thinking that later education can build upon.	<br><br>
This is where adults can start to help, by giving kids a way to express these concepts. “Kids are less intuitively drawn to the symbols we use to communicate math and science,” Mazzocco said. As a child starts to understand the concept of the number two, for example, a teacher or parent can connect that concept to the written symbol: 2. Even though kids can’t read or write out a math problem, parents and teachers can start helping them draw those connections and give kids the tools to use in the near future in school.	<br><br>
Written communication is only one way mathematical and scientific concepts are articulated. “Exposure to oral mathematical language early in life enhances children’s vocabulary growth,” Mazzocco said, just as it does with reading. When kids explore cause-and-effect relationships or spatial reasoning, adults can merely observe and suggest the language for what the child had already discovered. “You’re providing the child with lots of language to explain principles they might not have overtly noticed,” Mazzocco said.	<br><br>
“It’s too much to expect for an infant to solve an algebra problem, of course, but they’re picking up a lot more than we give their credit for.”	<br><br>
A more general way that parents and teachers can foster a child’s interest in math and science is just by being careful of how they portray these topics to kids, even subtly. “We have to be very cognizant of the attitudes we convey about math and science,” Mazzocco said. “Kids pick up on that.” Adults who say that they’re bad at math or science around kids show that these are skills they do not value highly, showing kids that they shouldn’t value them, either.	<br><br>
So, how early is too early for adults to start teaching kids about math and science? “It’s never too early,” Mazzocco said. “The question is the mode of delivery as opposed to the content [of these lessons.]” It’s too much to expect for an infant to solve an algebra problem, of course, but children start absorbing a lot of information from their environments early on―and they’re picking up a lot more than we give their credit for, Mazzocco added. Giving them the right environments and presenting them with the right attitudes toward math and science could go a long way toward their future success.	<br><br>

童年时不曾纯真，青年时不曾燃烧，成年时不曾成熟。一拨拨人也就这样胡乱长大了<br><br>

押沙龙  文 电子工程师 <br><br>


我小学的时候，老师告诉我们要好好学习，以后成为国家的栋梁，做未来的主人翁。那时我们的班主任是个很胖的女人，除了让我们做国家的栋梁，她还有个爱好，就是打她的儿子。他当时也在我们班。她经常把他叫到讲台上，左手拿着他的试卷，右手劈脸一个嘴巴，把这位未来主人翁打得脸一歪，然后反手一抽，把他的脸再正回来。现在我还模糊记得那个孩子的样子，瘦瘦小小，一脸惊恐，像只走投无路的老鼠。<br><br>

我们虽然是“文革”后的一代，但毕竟也是读着魏巍的“美国鬼子脑浆迸裂，涂了一地，另一个战士，嘴里还衔着敌人的半块耳朵”课文长大的，神经比较大条，后来有老师指着学生骂“你离我远点，我看见你就恶心”，大家还会哄堂大笑。直到我长大后回想，才能体会到其中包含的残酷。当时我们也没有太多选择，要么哄堂大笑，要么噤若寒蝉。当然，噤若寒蝉多少体面一些。但我们毕竟是笑了。说起来，当年的我们就是这样，写着春光明媚的作文，读着正义感爆棚的课文，被委以祖国未来主人翁的重任，然后在成年人营造的诡异世界里寻求适应之道。图画与真实之间咫尺之地，窄仄到了只适合一个未来的犬儒存身。
<br><br>
那个年代很多老师和家长都脾气暴躁。时过境迁后，我能理解他们的心情。他们生活压力很大，什么东西都缺，而且从来没有人真正告诉过他们怎么教育孩子，怎么对待儿童。谁懂得这些事情呢？说到底，从来也没有人真正告诉他们怎么做一个成人。多少年来，大家都已习惯由别人替自己做决定。直到今天，还有很多专门针对老人的商家，做广告的时候不贴“商讯”而贴“通知”，就是捉摸明白了这种心理。而他们容易上野广告的当，很大程度上也是因为他们对任何媒体都有一种敬畏感。如果你告诉他们那些“王教授”是假的，他们的第一反应就是：要是假的，电台怎么可能让它播呢？<br><br>

把成人当作孩子，把孩子当作傻子，这样会让人丧失很多成长的机会。童年时不曾纯真，青年时不曾燃烧，成年时不曾成熟。一拨拨人也就这样胡乱长大了。善良和懦弱混迹不清，而秩序只能从恐惧和顺从中学来。当然，也有不小的进步，现在的成人多少比以前懂事点了，但在本质上，做事的方式还是差不多。就像崔健说的，大家骨子里究竟还是同一代人。我上学的时候，见过都二十多岁了还因为在校园角落里接吻，被保卫科撵鸡撵狗一样乱撵的大学生。就算现在，我也经常读到学生被校长抓来就剃头之类的新闻。从来没有被人真正尊重过的孩子，怎么能在长大后懂得尊重他人呢？他们是未来的主人翁。<br><br>

小时候的语文课里，小明是最让人讨厌的。他总是提前完成作业，总是帮助后进的同学。他一举一动都那么正义，正义到了你会盼着他哪天因为偷看女厕所被抓起来。马克 吐温就有篇恶搞的短篇小说，叫《好孩子的故事》，在故事里，小明谴责小刚不该爬树偷苹果，说作文里说了你这样的坏孩子会掉下来摔断胳膊的。结果小刚果真掉下来砸断了小明的胳膊，小刚却安然无事。故事的最后，马克 吐温心满意足地写道：小明因为干好事太多被活活炸死了。我们可不敢这么写。相反，我们在小明的带动下，在作文里做各种各样从没干过的好事，干好事前一定要想到雷锋邱少云黄继光他们，干好事后语文刘老师则总是“脸上露出欣慰的笑容”。另外我们还经常路过刘老师的家门口，看见她的窗口还亮着灯光，那是刘老师在批改我们作文，于是内心涌起一阵暖流。我们就是写这种东西长大的。然后等到这个社会上卖假酒卖假药，大家又叫着说：“人这都是怎么了？怎么都变得这么没有诚信？”这又是在装什么呢？
<br><br>
好莱坞的主流片子不管拍得多烂多假，宣传的价值观多老生常谈，但它们总能给人这样的感觉，就是导演确信观众认可这些价值。那种庸俗是温情甜腻的庸俗。而中国导演们想要“提一提境界”时候，却往往弄到笑场的地步。这不光是因为导演笨拙，也有一个原因是，我们这里确实缺少了某种东西。在这样的环境里，教养一个孩子，多少是件让人困惑的事。有位朋友抱怨过，把孩子送进学校以后，眼看着她很多地方都在变蠢，却毫无办法。我也曾经和女儿童童一起，站在水族馆前漫长的队伍里，看着有一家老小谈笑着径直走进了旁门，听着门口的保安对抗议者喊“那就是给领导进的，就是不给你家孩子进，怎么着？”再瞅着身边那些不解的孩子们，不免产生了罗大佑式的迷惘：“想起了遥远的过去未曾实现的梦，曾经一度人们告诉你说你是未来的主人翁。”

高晓松痛批奶茶妹妹前男友梁植：上节目纠结找工作 你愧对清华教育<br><br>
2014-11-13<br><br>

“学霸男神”最近很火，15分满分的“清华男神”（腰鼓队的）韩衍隽引发的网络“膜拜”热度还未消退，另一位“清华男神”梁植又因一段视频而走红网络。昨日（12日）有网友在网上曝光了高晓松和蔡康永加盟的《奇葩说》节目片段，奶茶妹妹章泽天前男友，同时也是被称为“清华男神”梁植的奇葩找工作言论，让高晓松在节目中首次动怒。<br><br>
节目中刚一亮相，梁植就说自己拥有法律、金融、新闻传播三项清华学历，但现在为毕业做什么而苦恼，希望三位导师支招。没想才说了1分钟，好脾气的蔡康永就直接按铃淘汰，理由是节目需要选手有自己的观点提问，而不是让梁植来找工作。随后梁植极力为自己辩解，解释从本科、硕士到博士，为什么会选择这三个专业，并表示是为了丰富自己的经历。此时一旁的高晓松已经听不下去，调侃称：“你就是北京话说的那种，我干什么成什么。我啥也没干，所以我啥也没成。”而且高晓松还善意提醒，如果梁植不亮出点新观点，自己也准备按铃淘汰。<br><br>
梁植在视频中如是说道：“本科学法律，是想学习形式辩护的技能，但后来一位好友的话提醒了我。他说你学法就好比是一名篮球赛的裁判，可你都没有打过篮球，有什么资格去当裁判？于是，我就开始学习经济学，想对国际贸易这块有更深的了解。当时硕士快毕业了，也面试了，不过参加了一个中央台的主持人比赛，又发现自己可能会在这项领域有更深入的尝试。于是博士读了新闻传播……”谁知梁植刚一讲完自己的履历，高晓松就不以为然：“那你觉得你朋友说的是对的么？那你现在读了金融，可没掌握实业，你是不是还会去读机械？读了机械，发现自己没接触电，是不是还要去读电这一块的专业？”蔡康永也附议道：“可你已经将这几个专业都读出来了，说明你本身也有实力。可你就会因为别人的几句话就赌上你人生的好几年，这点让我觉得很危险。”<br><br>
高晓松随即继续开启嘲讽模式：“我觉得你现在就是这样：你学了三个专业，好比一个姑娘说我身材又好，啥都好，你们觉得我该嫁谁？！”梁植此时明显感到自己受到了冒犯，无可辩驳却又连连摇头。<br><br>
但之后梁植始终没有办法跳脱这个话题，此时的高晓松已经按捺不住火气，火力全开炮轰。直言自己知道梁植是目前清华在校最优秀的学生之一，但对于一个名校生，对国家、社会没有一些自己的想法，反而纠结在工作，如此小的格局实在有失清华高材生的身份。高晓松甚至以一句重话对梁植全盘否定：“一个名校生走到这里来，问我们你该找什么工作？你觉得你愧不愧对清华十多年的教育？”<br><br>
在参加《奇葩说》之前，对于有“清华男神”称号的梁植来说，履历表几乎无懈可击。本科、硕士、博士全在清华就读；2011CCTV电视节目主持人大赛铜奖获得者；2013北京市大学生戏剧节最佳男演员奖获得者；清华的歌手赛第一名……绝对算是清华大学的风云人物。<br><br>
实际上梁植还有一个身份，就是网络红人奶茶妹妹的前男友。根据网友爆料，当时两人同为清华校友，而且还是奶茶妹妹倒追梁植，不过随着奶茶妹妹最终情定富商刘强东，这段恋情也无疾而终。在参加《奇葩说》之前，梁植还参加过北京卫视《我是演说家》，并且走到了最后一轮，是夺冠大热门，但此次在《奇葩说》惨遭滑铁卢。网友称梁植就是高智商低情商，“奶茶妹妹不要你是对的。”<br><br>
不过令人好奇的是，梁植此次上《奇葩说》的表现完全与之前《我是演说家》中的自己判若两人。10月11日播出的北京卫视《我是演说家》第二期节目中，清华博士生梁植因其帅气的外表、精彩的演讲让他成为场上的宠儿，四位导师都希望将这名强将收入囊中，也因此为他展开了《我是演说家》的首次抢人大战。<br><br>
梁植以两弹元勋邓稼先为主题，阐述了个人付出与国家成就的关系。在他的演讲中，观众感受到了一位科学工作者的奉献及伟大。网友“齐昱”在看完视频后也连连感叹：“对于这种的题材演讲，我本来是不太感兴趣的，但那天看到后半段的时候真的流泪了，这个社会情怀少了，但并不代表没有存在过，没想到我们离那个时代那么近，邓稼先消失28年研究两弹回来国家只给了他二十块奖金，他因工作得了直肠癌晚期，如果活到现在也只有九十岁……”<br><br>
精彩的演讲，让刘嘉玲很快选定了他。其他导师自然也不想错过这位学霸，纷纷向他伸出橄榄枝，希望将他收入自己的队伍中。作为X导师的鲁豫，虽然无缘争夺这位演说者，但她仍然象征性的按下了选择按钮，以示对梁植的赞赏。乐嘉也道出自己认为梁植演说中最打动人的地方是细节。因为用细节和事实来打动人最有力量。不过，乐嘉作为导师，也履行职责指出了梁植的不足，如台词的痕迹感过重及表现形式过于正统。由于乐嘉的点评正中梁植的内心，梁植毫不犹豫的选择了进入乐嘉战队，让其他几位导师只剩下羡慕嫉妒的份儿了。<br><br>

Curricular Review, Large and Small<br><br>



By Benedict H. Gross and Jeffrey Wolcowitz, S June 10, 2004 <br><br>


 
 
1<br><br>
  


Under the leadership of Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) is in the midst of its first major review of the Harvard College curriculum since the mid-1970s. The report issued this spring offers a set of proposals that we believe will strengthen undergraduate education at Harvard and prepare students well for their post-college lives. Next year, the community will debate and refine the proposals and prepare to implement changes in the undergraduate curriculum.<br><br>
As we engage in this review, several questions come to mind. Is revision of the curriculum something that happens at Harvard only once every 30 years? Why is this the right time to undertake a major review? And, anticipating that our answer to the first question is no, to what degree does the recent report represent continuity or a discontinuous break with the past?<br><br>

The curriculum in Harvard College is renewed and energized on a regular basis. Faculty revise and update their courses to reflect the reframing of debates and advances in knowledge and to improve pedagogy. Departments develop new courses to reflect emerging areas of student and faculty interest. Departments and concentrations regularly re-evaluate and revise their curricula, changing requirements, restructuring course sequences and introducing new options for students.
<br><br>
Several years ago, for example, the two biology departments created a new course in genetics and genomics to serve as the gateway to concentration, introducing students early to the basic language of the life sciences. The English department revised its junior tutorial program two years ago to strengthen its intellectual content and to bring small groups of undergraduates together with one graduate student for each group to explore a topic of mutual interest, with emphasis on research and writing. With greater faculty strength and more courses in film studies, the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies will offer a new concentration track in this area next year. And last year, the Department of Afro-American Studies reconfigured itself as African and African American Studies, inaugurating an African languages program this year and a new concentration track in African studies for next year.<br><br>

The period since the 1997 review of the Core Program has been one of rapid change with respect to College-wide programs and degree requirements, as the Faculty has reviewed and modified particular aspects of the curriculum. <br><br>

The Faculty voted in 1997 to introduce Quantitative Reasoning as a new Core area, expanding the Core Program from 10 to 11 areas and the number of exemptions from 2 to 3. <br><br>

The Faculty also voted to allow department alternates to Core courses in the humanities and social science areas; these already existed in the science areas. The Core Standing Committee has focused on expanding the offerings in the Core proper, but 16 department courses in the humanities and social sciences now satisfy Core requirements.<br><br>

Language citations were introduced in 1999 to recognize and encourage sustained work in a foreign language. Today, 354 are being awarded in 18 languages. Students may use a language citation toward the Core Foreign Cultures requirement.<br><br>

The Faculty asked the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) to examine the overall number of requirements with an eye toward allowing more elective choices. The EPC focused on reducing the number of concentration requirements. One-third of the concentrations, including some of the largest, reduced requirements in at least one of their tracks.<br><br>

During the 2000-2001 academic year, the Faculty began an expansion of the Freshman Seminar Program to increase the opportunities for first-year students to benefit from small-group instruction. The program has expanded from 36 seminars offered that year to 114 to be offered next year. To open curricular space for students to enroll in seminars, the Faculty reduced the Core requirement from 8 to 7 of the 11 areas.<br><br>

Over the past two years, the Faculty has sought to make study abroad a more natural part of a Harvard College education, creating a new Office of International Programs and asking concentrations to facilitate a semester abroad. To lower one barrier to study abroad, the Core Standing Committee reduced the Core requirement by one area for each full term of study abroad. During the past year, 173 students studied abroad for one or both terms. This summer, 130 students will study abroad, including 35 enrolled in courses taught by Harvard faculty through the Summer School.<br><br>

So, why a major review of the undergraduate curriculum at this point in time? As University President Lawrence H. Summers often reminds us, no institution, no matter how strong, should go for more than 25 or 30 years without critical self-examination. Harvard must adapt to the profound changes in society. Moreover, the interconnected worlds of scholarship and teaching have changed significantly in many fields, and we must think collectively about what and how we teach, and for what purpose. The rapid rate of curricular innovation and change over the past several years far outpaces what we had seen during the period from the introduction of the Core in the 1970s until the 1997 review. This too is a sign that the time had come to step back from business as usual and take a comprehensive look at the curriculum to make certain that the various components provide a unified vision of what we seek to achieve in the education of Harvard College students.<br><br>

The recent report on the Harvard College Curricular Review reaffirms our commitment to a liberal education in the arts and sciences and outlines a curriculum in which students have greater freedom to shape their educations. While many of the recommendations represent new formats, opportunities and commitments, they bring together and recast many of the changes that were already being developed in the concentrations and in FAS at large: commitment to international education, growing emphasis on the sciences, opportunities for interdisciplinary work and more venues for students to work closely with faculty in small groups.<br><br>

If the changes outlined in the report are adopted, how might a student entering Harvard College a few years from now make her way through the curriculum? In consultation with an academic adviser, she will choose a freshman seminar or another small course that provides the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member. Another course will be devoted to advancing her skills in written and oral communication. She will also take foundational courses co-taught by faculty from FAS and perhaps from across the University that introduce her to important concepts and approaches from several fields. Her other courses freshman year and during the first term of sophomore year will allow her to explore areas of interest that will help her choose a concentration mid-way through the sophomore year. The wider range of choices available for meeting general education requirements eliminates the distinctions among general education, concentration and elective courses.
<br><br>
Once she has chosen a concentration―say, government with a special interest in international environmental policy―she will continue to work with an adviser to plan her academic program. She will take a junior seminar that focuses on a topic in international relations. She will also explore her interests in this area (and her secondary interest in Latin American literature) while studying for a term in Chile―and meet her language requirement by taking courses taught in Spanish during that term abroad. A smaller number of concentration requirements and greater flexibility to take related courses, as well as a larger number of electives, will allow her to support her interest in environmental issues by taking courses on the economics of the environment and science courses on climate change and environmental engineering (counting toward her physical science general education requirement). A January term might be used to travel to Costa Rica with a Harvard course on biodiversity. As a senior, she might enroll in a seminar on global warming, collaborating on a group project with classmates who are completing their concentrations in economics, history and science, biology and environmental science and public policy. And throughout her four years in the College, she will use electives to take a range of courses that allow her to pursue already-established interests and to develop new interests.

As Harvard College reinvents itself from generation to generation, it also continues a great tradition of providing outstanding education for undergraduates, adapting itself to changes in the world and in student and faculty interests, recognizing the great talent among both students and faculty and periodically taking stock to re-evaluate in a large way how well we are doing and how we might do better.

Benedict H. Gross ’71 and Jeffrey Wolcowitz are dean of the College and associate dean of the College, respectively.
