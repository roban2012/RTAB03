	<b><a name="T2">Inside the Ivory Tower</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

"Inside the Ivory Tower" is a ranking of the top university graduate and undergraduate programs in international relations. The ranking is produced by the Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project at the College of William & Mary and is published periodically by the magazine Foreign Policy. The TRIP project attempts to interview "international relations faculty from every four-year college and university in the United States, as identified by U.S. News & World Report," although the methodology has changed over the years.[1][2][3] The survey design and compilation of results are done by the College of William & Mary's Institute for the Theory and Practice of International Relations.[4]
<br><br>
The survey began in 2005 as a survey of International Relations Scholars in the United States. One of the questions asked respondents to rank International Relations graduate schools in the U.S. The survey has since been expanded to include undergraduate programs.[5] The survey began including universities outside of the U.S. in 2009.[1] The next iteration of the survey will be conducted in late summer of 2014. <br><br>

Inside the Ivory Tower<br><br>

Our third exclusive survey of international relations professors reveals they're worried about climate change, Russia's rise, and their own irrelevance. Plus: A ranking of the top schools for studying international relations. 
BY Katherine Yester	<br><br>
MARCH 1, 2009<br><br>
The walls surrounding the ivory tower have never seemed so high. U.S. President Barack Obama has picked the team of people who will craft his foreign policy, and guess who didn't make the A list? Only most of the experts tasked with explaining the way the world works. Unfortunately, professors of international relations and political science are often the last people a president turns to for advice on running the world. At least, that's what the professors say. 
<br><br>
Every two years, we survey international relations faculty from every four-year college and university in the United States, as identified by U.S. News & World Report. The 2008 results include the responses of 1,743 scholars collected between August and November of last year. Now, we're revealing the role professors think they play in policymaking today, and, more often, the frustrating lack of influence they think they have from their perch above the fray of international politics. Most revealing? Nearly 40 percent of respondents reported that these scholars have "no impact" on foreign policy or even the public discourse about it. Indeed, the only academics judged less effectual in the policy realm were historians. <br><br>

What is to blame for IR scholars' exile from the political process? In recent years, professors have become increasingly skeptical about the utility of much of their own research to policymakers. In 2006, 48 percent of respondents reported that contemporary case studies conducted by academics were "very useful" to policymakers, but by 2008 only 39 percent of respondents thought policymakers would find this work useful. 
<br><br>
Despite their perceived lack of influence, respondents in this year's survey firmly believe that academic experts can and should play an important role in policymaking. It's a conclusion that begs a provocative question: What would U.S. foreign policy look like if there were no wall between the ivory tower and the White House? 
<br><br>
If the Obama administration took as its blueprint the poll of views of international relations scholars on issues ranging from the economy to Iran, the results would be at once expected and surprising. It's a largely liberal internationalist agenda, one that names the most important foreign-policy priorities facing the United States as: global climate change (37 percent), the war in Iraq (35 percent), global reliance on oil (34 percent), armed conflict in the Middle East (32 percent), and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (27 percent). A large majority of the experts favor increases in foreign aid (85 percent), free trade agreements (70 percent), and increased spending on the global aids epidemic (59 percent). Although these scholars oppose using military force against Iran even as it allegedly pursues a nuclear weapons program, a clear majority favors humanitarian intervention in Sudan if conducted under the aegis of an international institution such as NATO or the United Nations. (It's worth noting that had the survey been sent in December, after the global economic collapse, financial issues likely would have secured a higher spot.) 
<br><br>
President Obama clearly shares the experts' concerns. On global warming, he has appointed a climate czar; on oil, he favors strengthening fuel-economy standards; and on the Iraq war, he is sticking to his plan to withdraw U.S. troops. Having one of their "own" in the White House -- a law professor with a liberal, like-minded agenda on the policymaking table -- may already have scholars feeling more included. 
<br><br>
Public Enemy No. 1 <br><br>

Political pundits and journalists may buzz reflexively over the latest economic stimulus package or saber-rattling by Iran. But scholars of international relations take a longer view, scanning the horizon for power shifts that could affect the global pecking order. 
<br><br>
So, which countries pose the greatest threat to the U.S. position today? Forty-three percent of respondents agreed that China's growing military power could threaten international stability. In fact, specialists predict that the strategic importance of East Asia generally will continue to grow. Although only 30 percent see the region as the one of greatest concern for the United States today (up from 19 percent in 2006), 68 percent reported it would be the region of greatest strategic importance in 20 years. 
<br><br>
What of the Middle East? Scholars seem to anticipate a dramatic easing of tensions in the region during the next two decades. Although 46 percent currently judge it the most vital region for the United States, only 11 percent say it will be the most strategically important in 20 years. 
<br><br>
Relatively close on the heels of the threat from East Asia seems to be the troubling potential for a Russian resurgence. When asked which country they would least like to see displace the United States as hegemon, 60 percent said Russia. (Just 51 percent named China.) Sometimes, the oldest patterns are the hardest to break. 
<br><br>
Climate Change 
<br><br>
What issue could possibly trump a major recession and not one but two foreign wars? Our warming planet. According to the scholars in this year's survey, a U.S. commitment to take the lead on international climate treaties is long overdue. Although the election of President Obama -- who has described the global climate change threat as "a matter of urgency" -- promises movement on U.S. environmental policy, it might not be nearly high enough on Obama's to-do list for these experts. Not only do academics consider the environment to be the greatest threat we face today, they predict it will be an even more important foreign-policy challenge for the United States in 10 years. 
<br><br>
There remains, however, a disconnect between these findings and the type of research that scholars are conducting at leading educational institutions in the United States. The dialogue in scholarly journals often gives the impression that the United States is still fighting the Cold War -- that threats to national security come largely from great powers and from states that have or seek nuclear weapons. Although 40 percent of the scholars who responded claim their primary or secondary research focus is on international security issues, only 7 percent of respondents focused on international environmental issues. 
<br><br>
If They Had a Billion Dollars 
<br><br>
What if President Obama allotted IR scholars a $1 billion budget to spend as they saw fit over the course of the next fiscal year? <br><br>

Although 85 percent of academics report that the U.S. foreign-aid budget should expand overall, scholars also agree about where not to spend the money -- the military. Sixty-four percent of experts say that U.S. spending on defense should decline. Instead, when security and economic issues are taken off the table and scholars are given a three-way choice among foreign aid, global AIDS spending, and climate change, the majority of these academics would spend any windfall on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
<br><br>
Who's at the Top of the Class? 
<br><br>
Dramatic changes in the ranking of leading IR programs are rare. This year's findings provide no exception; the perennial powers stay on top. 
<br><br>
For the top two seats in all three categories -- Ph.D., master's, and undergraduate programs -- Harvard and Princeton, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins, and Harvard and Princeton, respectively, maintained their slots. But that's not to say nothing changed: Stanford unseated Columbia's doctoral program and climbed to the No. 3 slot. In the undergraduate ranking, Yale took the No. 3 spot from Stanford. 
<br><br>
With four of the top master's programs located within or just outside the U.S. capital, the hot spot to pursue the policy track remains inside the Washington Beltway. Those more interested in purely academic pursuits will want to tread the coastlines; the northeast corridor is home to five of the top 10 Ph.D. programs, and California has three of its own in the top 10. <br><br>

The 2008 survey also asked scholars to identify the top Ph.D. programs in the world for studying international relations. When forced to think beyond the American academy, respondents produced a British invasion. For the first time, three schools from Britain made the list of top programs for students wanting to pursue an academic career in IR: the London School of Economics (12), Oxford University (13), and Cambridge University (20). Competitive eyes should keep a steady watch -- there may be more movement still to come from across the pond. 
<br><br>
The Five International Relations Professors Named the Most Influential Answer: 
<br><br>
What is the most dangerous and overlooked threat Obama neglects to his peril?  
<br><br>
"The most dangerous, but relatively neglected security threat would be the 'dark side' implications of the rapid development and worldwide diffusion of biotechnology." 
<br><br>
-- James Fearon, Stanford University 
<br><br>
"There is the very real possibility that Mexico will implode on Obama's watch and become a failed state, which would surely cause serious problems north of the Rio Grande." 
<br><br>
-- John Mearsheimer, University of Chicago 
<br><br>
"The most dangerous overlooked threat that we neglect at our peril? Ourselves. The imperative must be not only that 'they' recognize 'us,' but that 'we' recognize 'them,' too." 
<br><br>
-- Alexander Wendt, Ohio State University 
<br><br>
"In the 1930s, economic crisis led to Nazism in Germany and militarism in Japan. We must not overlook the threat that global economic crisis could again have malign effects on world politics." 
<br><br>
-- Robert Keohane, Princeton University 
<br><br>
"Throughout history overwhelmingly strong states have abused their power. Getting the defense budget under control is President Obama's greatest, and I fear his least understood, challenge." 
<br><br>
-- Kenneth N. Waltz, Columbia University

Georgetown University is a private research university in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Jesuit and Catholic university in the United States. Georgetown's main campus, located in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood, is noted for Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark in the Romanesque revival style. Georgetown operates a law center on Capitol Hill and auxiliary campuses in Italy, Turkey, and Qatar.	<br><br>
Georgetown's founding by John Carroll, America's first Catholic bishop, realized earlier efforts to establish a Roman Catholic college in the province of Maryland that had been thwarted by religious persecution. The university expanded after the American Civil War under the leadership of Patrick Francis Healy, who came to be known as Georgetown's "second founder" despite having been born a slave by law. Jesuits have participated in the university's administration since 1805, a heritage Georgetown celebrates, but the university has always been governed independently of the Society of Jesus and of church authorities.	<br><br>
The university has about 7,000 undergraduate and over 10,000 post-graduate students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including 130 foreign countries.[5][8] The university's most notable alumni are prominent in public life in the United States and abroad. Among them are former U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, dozens of U.S. governors and members of Congress, heads of state or government of more than a dozen countries, royalty and diplomats.	<br><br>
Campus organizations include the country's largest student-run business and largest student-run financial institution. Georgetown's athletic teams, nicknamed the Hoyas, include a men's basketball team that has won a record-tying seven Big East championships, appeared in five Final Fours, and won a national championship in 1984.	<br><br>
Jesuit settlers from England founded the Province of Maryland in 1634.[9] However, the 1646 defeat of the Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including Andrew White, and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor.[1] During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until after the end of the American Revolution that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.[	<br><br>
Because of Benjamin Franklin's recommendation, Pope Pius VI appointed former Jesuit John Carroll as the first head of the Roman Catholic Church in America, even though the papal suppression of the Jesuit order was still in effect. Carroll began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near Annapolis, Maryland, where they orchestrated the development of a new university.[11] On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized the purchase of the property on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later built.[12] Future Congressman William Gaston was enrolled as the school's first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792.[11]	<br><br>
During its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands owned by ex-Jesuits.[13] The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college.[14] The United States Congress issued Georgetown the first federal university charter in 1815, which allowed it to confer degrees, and the first Bachelor degrees were awarded two years later.[15] In 1844, the school received a corporate charter, under the name "The President and Directors of Georgetown College", affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Roman Catholic students, the Medical School was founded in 1851.[	<br><br>
Civil War 	<br><br>
The U.S. Civil War greatly affected Georgetown as 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in one army or the other, and the Union Army commandeered university buildings.[10] By the time of President Abraham Lincoln's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400 troops were living in temporary quarters there. Due to the number of lives lost, enrollment levels remained low until well after the war was over. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade.[17] At its founding in 1876, the Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's rowing team, adopted blue, used for Union uniforms, and gray, used for Confederate uniforms, as its colors to signify the peaceful unity among students.[18] Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors.	<br><br>
Enrollment did not recover from the war until the presidency of Patrick Francis Healy from 1873 to 1881. Born a slave by law, Healy was the first acknowledged head of a predominantly white American university with African heritage.[b] He is credited with reforming the undergraduate curriculum, lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the Alumni Association. One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named Healy Hall in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's "second founder."[19]	<br><br>
Expansion	<br><br>
After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education.[14] The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903.[20] Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the University in 1927.[21] The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to prepare students for leadership in foreign commerce and diplomacy.[14] The School of Business was created out of the SFS in 1957, and in 1998 was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.[22]	<br><br>
Besides expansion of the University, Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university was made available on a limited basis by 1952.[23] With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969C1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully coeducational.[24] Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo J. O'Donovan as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to build the school's endowment.[25] In December 2003, Georgetown completed the campaign after raising over $1 billion for financial aid, academic chair endowment, and new capital projects.[26] John J. DeGioia, Georgetown's first lay president, has led the school since 2001, and has continued its financial modernization and sought to "expand opportunities for intercultural and interreligious dialogue", such as by opening a campus in Qatar.[27]	<br><br>
Jesuit tradition 	<br><br>

Georgetown University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola and is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.[12][28] Georgetown is not a pontifical university, though six Jesuits serve on the thirty-six member Board of Directors, the school's highest governance.[29] Fifty-two members of the Society of Jesus live on campus, and are mostly employed by Georgetown as professors or administrators.[30] Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.[31]	<br><br>
The role that Georgetown's Catholic heritage has played in its policies has been controversial at times, even as its influence is relatively limited.[32] Stores in University-owned buildings are not allowed to sell or distribute birth control products.[33] Georgetown University Medical Center and Georgetown University Hospital, operated by MedStar Health, are prohibited from performing abortions.[34] As recently as 2004, the hospital did perform research using embryonic stem cells.[35] Georgetown has drawn criticism from religious groups such as the Cardinal Newman Society for hosting speeches from prominent pro-choice politicians, including John Kerry and Barack Obama,[36][37] and from Washington's Archbishop, Donald Wuerl, for inviting Kathleen Sebelius to be a commencement speaker.[38] The university does host the Cardinal O'Connor Conference on Life every January to discuss the pro-life movement.[39]	<br><br>
Between 1996 and 1999, crucifixes were added to many classroom walls, attracting national attention.[40] Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms.[41] Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such.[42] According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement.[43] The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby.[44]	<br><br>

As of 2014, the University has 7,636 undergraduate students, and 10,213 graduate students.[5] Bachelor's programs are offered through Georgetown College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business, the School of Continuing Studies, and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, which includes the Qatar campus. Some high school students from Georgetown Visitation are permitted to attend classes for Advanced Placement credit.[45]	<br><br>
Georgetown University offers undergraduate degrees in forty-eight majors in the four undergraduate schools, as well as the opportunity for students to design their own individualized courses of study.[46] All majors in the College are open as minors to students in the College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, and the School of Business. Students in the School of Foreign Service cannot receive minors, but can complete certificates instead. All courses are on a credit hour system.[14] Georgetown offers many opportunities to study abroad, and about 50% of the undergraduate student body spends time at an institution overseas.[47]	<br><br>
Master's and doctoral programs are offered through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law Center, the School of Medicine, and the School of Continuing Studies. Masters students occasionally share some advanced seminars with undergraduates, and most undergraduate schools offer abbreviated bachelors and masters programs following completion of the undergraduate degree. The McDonough School of Business and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service both offer masters programs. The Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and the Public Policy Institute are both research centers which also offer masters degrees. In 2013, the Public Policy Institute received a $100 million grant from Frank McCourt, and became the McCourt School of Public Policy in October 2013.[48]	<br><br>
Each graduate school offers at least one double degree with another graduate school.[49] Additionally, the Law Center offers a joint degree with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.[50] The School of Continuing Studies includes the Center for Continuing and Professional Education, and operates four types of degree programs, over thirty professional certificates and non-degree courses, undergraduate and graduate degrees in Liberal Studies, as well as summer courses for graduates, undergraduates, and high school students.[51]	<br><br>
Research 	<br><br>

Georgetown University is a self-described "student-centered research university"[61] considered by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to have "very high research activity."[62] As of 2014, Georgetown's libraries held over 3.5 million printed items, including 1.25 million e-books, in seven buildings, with most in Lauinger Library.[63] The Blommer Science Library, located in the Reiss Science Building on campus, houses most of the Science collection. Additionally, the Law School campus includes the nation's fifth largest law library.[64] Georgetown faculty conduct research in hundreds of subjects, but have priorities in the fields of religion, ethics, science, public policy, and cancer medicine.[65] Cross-institutional research is performed with Columbia University and Virginia Tech.	<br><br>
In 2012, Georgetown spent $180 million on research, ranking it 108th nationwide.[66] In 2007, it received about $14.8 million in federal funds for research, with 64% from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, the United States Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense.[67] In 2010, the school received $5.6 million from the Department of Education to fund fellowships in several international studies fields.[68] Georgetown University Medical Center received an additional $118.4 million from these and other government sources.[67] Georgetown's Vincent Lombardi Cancer Center is one of 41 research-intensive comprehensive cancer centers in the United States, and developed the breakthrough HPV vaccine for cervical cancer[69] and Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells (CRC) technology.[70]	<br><br>
Centers which conduct and sponsor research at Georgetown include the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, the Prince Alwaleed Center for MuslimCChristian Understanding and the Woodstock Theological Center. Regular publications include the Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy, the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, the Georgetown Law Journal, the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, and the Georgetown Public Policy Review.	<br><br>

Although Jesuit schools are not obliged to disassociate from Greek systems, many do, and Georgetown University officially recognizes and funds only one of the many Greek organizations on campus, Alpha Phi Omega, the national co-ed community service fraternity. Despite this, other Greek organizations also persist on campus, although none requires members to live in fraternal housing.[177] Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges.[178]	<br><br>
Active fraternities at Georgetown include Delta Phi Epsilon, a professional foreign service fraternity and sorority; Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional co-ed business fraternity; Alpha Phi Omega, a national co-ed community service fraternity; Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish social fraternity; and social fraternities Sigma Phi Epsilon, Zeta Psi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Delta Phi Epsilon was founded at Georgetown in 1920, and members of their Alpha Chapter include Jesuits and several deans of the School of Foreign Service.[179] The Delta Phi Epsilon foreign service sorority, founded in 1973, is the only professional sorority active at Georgetown.[180] In October 2013 the first true Greek sorority came to the Georgetown campus with the Eta Tau chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma.[181] Georgetown's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi,was established in 2002.[182] Sigma Phi Epsilon chartered its chapter as a general social fraternity in 2007.[183] The Omega Lambda chapter of professional business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi replaced Delta Sigma Pi, which lost its charter in 2006.[184] The Zeta Psi chapter, named Gamma Epsilon, was chartered in March 2009 after a year as a colony.[185]	<br><br>

乔治城大学（英语：Georgetown University）位于美国首都华盛顿哥伦比亚特区，是一所私立研究型大学。该大学建立于1789年，是美国最古老的耶稣会和天主教大学。乔治城大学的主校区位于华盛顿乔治城，以古罗马式建筑风格的美国国家历史名胜希利堂为著称。乔治城大学在华盛顿特区的国会山设有法学院，在意大利、土耳其和卡塔尔设有分校[8]。	<br><br>
乔治城大学是由美国首位天主教主教约翰・卡罗尔建立的。在此之前，天主教教徒曾经致力于在马里兰省建立一所罗马天主教大学，但受到了宗教迫害的阻止。美国内战之后，该校在帕特里克・弗朗西斯・希利的领导下得到进一步发展。尽管希利在法律上具有奴隶身份，他对乔治城大学的贡献仍使其以“再造之父”为人所熟知。从1805年起，耶稣会会士进入学校管理层。这一传统得到了乔治城大学的秉持。然而，学校的治理一直独立于耶稣会和教会当局。	<br><br>
乔治城大学约有7000名本科生和8000余名研究生，他们来自全球130多个国家，具有不同宗教和民族背景[5][9]。该校知名校友大多在美国和世界各国的公共事务领域中表现突出，其中包括美国前总统比尔・克林顿、现任美国最高法院大法官安东宁・斯卡利亚、数十位美国州长和国会议员、数十个国家的元首和政府首脑、王室成员及外交官。	<br><br>
在乔治城大学的校园组织中，有着美国全国最大的学生企业。乔治城大学运动队名为乔治城大学惊叹队。其中，乔治城大学男子篮球队曾经追平纪录，七次获得美国大东联盟男子篮球锦标赛冠军。另外，还曾五次进入四强，并于1984年夺得全国冠军。	<br><br>
来自英国的罗马天主教耶稣会定居者早在1634年就建立了马里兰省[10]。不过，由于保王党在英国内战当中失利，产生了针对天主教教育更为严格的法律。这些法律使得安德鲁・怀特等殖民地知名耶稣会士被引渡回英格兰，从而使卡尔弗顿庄园的学校遭到毁灭[1]，因此在马里兰接下来的大部分殖民地时期当中，耶稣会士只能秘密建立学校。直至美国革命结束后，在美国建立永久的天主教教育机构的计划才得以实现[11]。	<br><br>
在本杰明・富兰克林的建议下，教皇庇护六世任命前耶稣会士约翰・卡罗尔为首位美国罗马天主教教会总主教，而当时教皇对耶稣会的压制仍在继续。卡罗尔于1783年在马里兰安那波利斯附近召开了首次教职人员会议，在这次会议上他提出要筹建一所新大学[12]。1789年1月23日，卡罗尔买下了一片地产并于此建造了达格伦四方院[13]。后来的国会议员威廉・加斯顿于1791年11月22日入学成为该校首位学生，授课开始于1792年1月2日[12]。	<br><br>
最初，乔治城学院财政上十分紧张，不得不依靠私人募集和当地前耶稣会士提供的有限资金维持运营[14]。马里兰耶稣会于1805年重建，学校教师和管理人员与耶稣会建立的联系使学院大受鼓舞[15]。美国国会于1815年为乔治城学院颁布了大学特许状，允许其颁发学位，首次颁发学位是在两年之后[16]。1844年，该学校获得了法人许可状，其名称为“乔治城学院校长及其他院长”，从而使学校获得了更多法律上的权力。应当地罗马天主教学生的要求，乔治城学院于1851年建立医学院[17]。	<br><br>
美国内战极大地影响了乔治城大学，其中该大学有1141名学生或校友参加了内战中的一方或另一方，联邦军还征用了该大学的建筑[11]。1861年5月，美国总统亚伯拉罕・林肯来到校园时，学校里的临时营地已驻扎了1400人。由于死伤严重，乔治城大学的入学水平在战争结束后相当长的一段时间内都很低。1869年毕业生数量仅仅为7人，而前十年的水平为300人[18]。刺杀林肯的同谋大卫・赫罗德曾在1855年至1858年在乔治城大学学习，并于1860年获得了药学文凭。该校的赛艇队乔治城学院划船俱乐部在1876年成立时，采用联邦军制服的蓝色和邦联军制服的灰色为其颜色，以显示学生间的和平统一[19]。在此之后，蓝灰被学校采用为其官方颜色。	<br><br>
直到1873年至1881年帕特里克・弗朗西斯・希利任校长期间，乔治城大学的入学水平才得以从战争中恢复。依照当时法律，希利出生时的身份为奴隶。因此，他是美国历史上第一个在白人主导的大学当中担任校长的具有非裔背景的人[b]。在希利担任校长期间，他改革了本科生课程，延长了医学和法学专业的时间，还建立了校友会。与此同时，他主持建造了一幢重要的新建筑，即后来以他的名字命名的希利堂。由于希利的贡献，他被认为是该校的“再造之父”[20] 。	<br><br>
扩建时期[编辑]	<br><br>
1870年法学院建立后，希利和他的继任者希望把各个专业学院联合起来组建成一所综合性大学，并使之专注于高等教育[15]。1医学院于1901年增设牙科学院，与1903年增设颁发本科学位的护理和健康研究学院[21]。1919年，乔治城预备校从校园中重新选址并于1927年和大学完全分离[22]。1919年，外交服务学院由埃德蒙・A・沃尔什建立，以培养外贸和外交方面的领导人才[15]。1957年，商学院和外交服务学院分离，并于1998年以罗伯特・E・麦克唐纳之名重新命名为麦克唐纳商学院[23]。	<br><br>
除了对大学进行扩建，乔治城大学同时也扩充资金和招生规模为目标。护理学院自其建立以来就开始招收女生，而其他学院在1952年前只对女生有限开放[24]。随着1969至1970学年文理学院开始招收女生，乔治城大学最终完全实现男女同校[25]。乔治城大学在两百年校庆时选举里奥・J・奥多诺万担任校长。为了为学校募集更多资金，他发起了“第三世纪运动”[26]。2003年12月，乔治城大学完成了该运动，筹集了逾10亿美元的资金[27]。自2001年起，约翰・德吉奥亚成为首位世俗校长，并开始领导乔治城大学。他继续进行财政现代化，且试图“扩展文化间和宗教间的对话”，其措施包括在卡塔尔建立校区[28] 。	<br><br>
耶稣会传统 	<br><br>
乔治城大学是由前耶稣会士依照依纳爵・罗耀拉的传统建立的，是耶稣会学院和大学联合会的一员[13][29]。虽然在学校的最高管理机构董事会的36人中有6名耶稣会士，但是乔治城大学不属于宗座大学[30]。52名耶稣会士住在校园中，他们大多数被乔治城大学聘为教授或管理人员[31]。从2001年起，乔治城大学每年都会举办“耶稣会传统周”，以纪念耶稣会士为乔治城大学做出的贡献[32]。	<br><br>
尽管影响有限，乔治城大学的天主教传统仍不时引发争议[33]。如大学所属的商店不被允许散发或售卖避孕产品[34]，乔治城大学医学中心和乔治城大学医院被禁止进行堕胎[35]。不过，2004年的时候，该学校仍利用胚胎干细胞进行了相关研究[36]。此外，乔治城大学由于邀请了支持堕胎合法化的政治家如约翰・克里、巴拉克・奥巴马在学校发表演说，从而招致了宗教团体如纽曼主教社的批评[37][38]，该学校还由于邀请凯瑟琳・西贝利厄斯发表开学典礼讲话而受到华盛顿总教区大主教唐纳德・威廉・维尔的批评[39]。乔治城大学每年一月也举行奥康纳主教会议以讨论支持生命运动[40]。	<br><br>
1996年至1999年间，由于在墙上悬挂十字架，乔治城大学引发了全国关注[41]。1996年前，十字架只在医院和历史教室里出现过[42]，其中一些十字架是历史文物或艺术品[43]。不过，校内的穆斯林神职人员汗迪称移除十字架的压力大部分来自天主教社区，而他和其他校内信众对此并无异议[44]。由于文化交流中心时常更换不同宗教和文化的标志而没有因此卷入争议[45]。	<br><br>
学术 	<br><br>
截至2010年，乔治城大学有7553名本科生和5832名研究生[5]。学士学位由乔治城学院、护理和健康研究学院、麦克唐纳商学院、继续教育学院、埃德蒙・A・沃尔什外交服务学院及其卡塔尔分校颁发。一些来自访问计划的高中生被允许参加大学先修课程以获得学分[46]。	<br><br>
乔治城大学的4个本科学院提供48个专业的本科学位，也为学生提供设计个性化课程的机会[47]。学院的所有专业都为学院、护理学院和商学院的学生开放申请辅修。外交服务学院的学生无法辅修，但可以修得多个学位。所有课程都基于学分制[15]。乔治城也提供许多出国学习的计划，58.6%的本科生曾前往海外机构留学[48]。	<br><br>

Georgetown graduates have found success in a wide variety of fields, and have served at the heads of diverse institutions both in the public and private sector. Immediately after graduation, about 54C61% of undergraduates enter the workforce, while others go on to additional education.[213] Georgetown graduates have been recipients of 23 Rhodes Scholarships,[214] 21 Marshall Scholarships,[215] 26 Truman Scholarships,[216] and 14 Mitchell Scholarships.[217] Georgetown is also one of the top-ten yearly producers of Peace Corps volunteers as of 2010,[218] with 35 active and 866 total volunteers since 1961.[219] Georgetown alumni have a median starting salary of $55,000 with a median mid-career salary of $110,000.[213] NNDB, the Notable Names Database, lists 364 notable alumni as of 2013.[220]<br><br>

Eight former heads of state are alumni. Former President of the United States Bill Clinton is a 1968 graduate of the School of Foreign Service, and other former world leaders include Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica,[221] Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines,[222] Saad Hariri of Lebanon,[223] and Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador. Two SFS graduates are also currently elected presidents, Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania, who completed a six-month program in 1992,[224] and Zeljko Komsic, one of the tripartite Presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[225] Six alumni serve in the United States Senate, and thirteen in the House of Representatives. Current congressional alumni include Dick Durbin, Senate majority whip, and Steny Hoyer, House minority whip.[226] Governor Pat Quinn of Illinois graduated from the SFS in 1971 while Governor Terry McAuliffe of Virginia received his J.D. from the Law Center in 1984.[227][228] On the U.S. Supreme Court, alumni include current Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and former Chief Justice Edward Douglass White.[220] Members of the current Obama Administration cabinet include Treasury Secretary Jack Lew who graduated from the law school in 1983 and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel who was a faculty member at the School of Foreign Service from 2009 through 2013.<br><br>

King Felipe VI of Spain, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud of the Saudi Arabia royal family, and Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark are among the royals who attended Georgetown.[229] Besides numerous members of the senior diplomatic corps, graduates have also headed military organizations on both the domestic and international level, such as former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former National Security Advisor General James L. Jones.[230] Notable alumni in business include Patricia Russo, former Alcatel-Lucent CEO, William J. Doyle of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, and Ted Leonsis, owner of the Washington Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics franchises and former America Online executive.[231][232] Leonsis is among four other undergraduate alumni who own professional sports teams, making Georgetown the most popular undergraduate university for major North American sports franchise owners.[233] Actor Bradley Cooper, People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive 2011, is also a graduate of Georgetown and its English program.[234]<br><br>


Alpha Phi Omega (ΑΦΩ) (commonly known as APO,[4] but also A-Phi-O[5] and A-Phi-Q[6]) is the largest collegiate fraternity in the United States, with chapters at over 350 campuses, an active membership of over 25,000 students, and over 400,000 alumni members. There are also 250 chapters in the Philippines and one in Australia.<br><br>

Alpha Phi Omega is a National co-ed service fraternity organized to provide community service, leadership development, and social opportunities for college students. Chapters range in size from approximately 10-20 active members to over 200 active members, independent of each college's size[citation needed].<br><br>

The purpose of the fraternity is "to assemble college students in a National Service Fraternity in the fellowship of principles derived from the Scout Oath and Scout Law of the Boy Scouts of America; to develop Leadership, to promote Friendship, and to provide Service to humanity; and to further the freedom that is our national, educational, and intellectual heritage."[7] Unlike many other fraternities, APO's primary focus is to provide volunteer service within four areas: service to the community, service to the campus, service to the fraternity, and service to the nation.
<br><br>
Being primarily a service organization, the fraternity restricts its chapters from maintaining fraternity houses to serve as residences for their members. This also encourages members of social fraternities and sororities that have houses to join APO as well.<br><br>

截至2011年，乔治城大学在全华盛顿地区三个校区中共雇佣了1291名全职及882名兼职教职人员[3]，此外，在卡塔尔分校中还有其他教职员[52]。教职员中包括不少杰出学者和知名政界及商界领袖，性别比例以男性占主导，约占总人数的三分之二[53]。在政治上，乔治城大学的教职员倾向于支持自由派候选人，而他们的捐资倾向与美国其他大学的教职人员一致。在乔治城大学教职员中，有超过平均水平比例的人在近年的美国大选中支持奥巴马[54][55]。
<br><br>
当今教职员中包括美国哲学学会会长詹姆斯・J・奥唐纳、神学家约翰・霍特、社会活动家山姆・马鲁洛和范德布卢姆及知名嘻哈学者迈克尔・埃里克・戴森[56][57]。许多前政治家也选择在乔治城教书，如美国前国务卿马德琳・奥尔布赖特、美国国际开发署前署长安德鲁・纳齐奥斯、国家安全事务顾问安东尼・雷克、中央情报总监（中央情报局局长）乔治・特尼特。在国际上，该学校吸引了不少其他国家的原大使和国家元首，如沙特大使图尔・基阿尔・费萨尔亲王、西班牙前首相何塞・玛丽亚・阿斯纳尔和哥伦比亚前总统阿尔瓦罗・乌里韦・贝莱斯[58][59][60]。
1979年12月，约翰・戴维森・洛克菲勒的孙女玛格丽特・洛克菲勒将“悬崖别墅”赠与了乔治城大学。该别墅位于意大利佛罗伦萨城边的一座山上的菲耶索莱。该别墅被用于研究意大利文化与文明的跨学科全年留学项目。而麦克吉东地中海研究中心的主建筑是由乔治城大学校友、前美国驻土耳其大使乔治・麦克吉于1989年捐赠的。该学校位于土耳其阿拉尼亚塞尔柱时代的阿拉尼亚城堡。在该中心每学期开办有国外留学项目，着力研究土耳其语、建筑史和伊斯兰研究。<br><br>

2002年，卡塔尔科学教育与社会发展基金会为埃德蒙・A・沃尔什外交服务学院提供了在卡塔尔多哈教育城开办机构的资源和空间[106]。外交学院卡塔尔分校于2005年开办，为该地区的学生教授文科和国际事务的课程[107]。2007年12月，乔治城大学在中国上海与复旦大学等合作开办了联络办公室[108]。2008年，乔治城大学法律中心与许多他国的法学院在英国伦敦建立了跨国法律研究中心[109
在种族多样性方面，该学校学生中有62.3%为白人，8.8%为亚洲裔，6.3%为非洲裔，5.9%为西班牙裔。此外，55.2%的本科生为女性[63]。
<br><br>
 
虽然该学生是一所耶稣会学校，不过2009年学生当中只有41%认为自己是罗马天主教教徒，另有22%认为自己是新教教徒[112]。由于本科生中有6.5%的人是犹太人，所以学校雇了一名全职拉比[112]。该学校也是美国第一所雇有全职伊玛目的院校，以为学校中超过400人的穆斯林服务[113]。乔治城大学也资助有巴哈伊信仰、佛教、印度教和摩门教传统的学生团体[114]。学生中既有信教的学生也有不信教的学生。
乔治城大学的学生组织包括设立于1830年美国历史最悠久的辩论俱乐部“同好社”（Philodemic Society）[130]和美国历史最悠久的大学戏剧社“面具与花哨戏剧社”（Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society）[131]。
<br><br>
乔治城大学的毕业生在多种领域中取得了成功，并在公共和私有领域的多种机构中担任首脑。毕业之后，约有54%―61%的本科生进入劳动力市场，而其他人则继续深造。乔治城大学毕业生已获得了23次罗德奖学金[201]、21次马歇尔奖学金[202]、26次杜鲁门奖学金[203]。乔治城大学每年和平队志愿者数量都进入了前十的排名，2010年[204]，有35人，而自1961年起则中共有866人。乔治城大学毕业生起薪中位数为55000美元，而事业中途薪水中位数为110000美元[205]。2013年，知名数据库（Notable Names Database）中列出的知名校友人数为364人[206]。

Greek for Beginners, L.A.Wilding	<br><br>
Primer of Greek Gramma, Evelyn Abbott	<br><br>

<a href= "link02.html">STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)</a><br><br>

年代比较古老，time-honored,国内许多会古希腊语的学者都是这套教材哺育的呢~ 比较注重词法，分类非常清楚，但句法的掌握是靠书中大量的练习来完成的，题目出的非常有水平，都是古代作家的简化或原文。入手不难的。	<br><br>
Reading Greek, JACT	<br><br>
英国人出版的，强调阅读，认为应该像小学生学语文课那样，理解文本不必须知道太多细致的语法，不苛求语法的系统性，词汇量很大。入门的时候读起来会很给人信心，但个人觉得还是有必要找本语法书看看的，Primer of Greek Gramma是个不错的选择。	<br><br>
Greek: An Intensive Course, Hardy Hansen	<br><br>
美国人的教材，哈佛等学校都用这套教材，这三套教材中最为强调语法系统行的，很细致，有很多很好的练习，但缺点是容易把那些学习古希腊语意愿不那么强烈的同学吓到，需要花很多时间的。	<br><br>
二、语法书	<br><br>
Smyth, Greek Grammar.	<br><br>
各种语法书其实不少的，但最通用的还是Smyth, 年代久经得起考验，而且广为接受。	<br><br>
学会基础语法之后，学生时代的古希腊语法Smyth足矣！	<br><br>

James Morwood is Fellow at Wadham College, Oxford and Grocyn Lecturer for the Literae Humaniores Faculty	<br><br>
James Morwood (born 25 November 1943)[1] is an emeritus Grocyn Lecturer in Classics and Fellow of Wadham College at Oxford University. He has translated four volumes of Euripides' plays for Oxford World's Classics. His other books include A Dictionary of Latin Words and Phrases,[2] The Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek, Our Greek and Latin Roots	<br><br>
James Morwood, Emeritus Fellow, Wadham College and Editor of Wadham Gazette	<br><br>
James Morwood was elected to a Fellowship at Wadham College in 1966, where he taught and served as Dean of Degrees, Steward of Common Room, and Dean (the last post from 2000 to 2006). He became an Emeritus Fellow in 2006 and remains Editor of the Wadham Gazette. He still does some teaching at the college.	<br><br>
James was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he sat Part I of the Classical Tripos and Part II of the English Tripos. After a year at Merton College, Oxford on the course for the Diploma of Education, he went to Harrow School in September 1966 to teach Classics and English. He spent 30 years at Harrow, the last seventeen of them as Head of Classics. He was deeply involved in school journalism and drama, working with Richard Curtis and Ben Cumberbatch among many others. He was librarian for more than eleven years, and sat on and later chaired the school’s Treasures Committee, a body which brought into existence the Old Speech Room Gallery.	<br><br>
In 1996 he moved to Oxford University and took up the post of Grocyn Lecturer in the Classics Faculty and served for a year as President of the Oxford Philological Society. 	<br><br>
James has been a committed member of the Joint Association of Classical Teachers and held the Presidency of the Association for 1999-2001, becoming an Honorary Member in 2011.

 Current projects include an edition of Virgil, Aeneid 3 (with Stephen Heyworth), an edition (with Chris Collard) of Euripides' Iphigenia at Aulis and A Little Greek Reader (with Stephen Anderson - Oxford University Press). He lectures on cruises in the Adriatic and Aegean, this September sailing from Istanbul to Athens. He will be attending the American Philological Association’s conference in Chicago in January. His proferred talk, ‘Burn Wheelock’, was sadly not accepted!	<br><br>
三、字典	<br><br>
An intermediate Greek- English  Lexicon	<br><br>
是LSJ的中级版本，LSJ作为作为权威的古希腊字典，太厚，不方便携带，所以这本书是很好的选择，博士毕业之前，一般的阅读足够保证。但需要注意的是，无论是LSJ,还是这本中级，使用的英语是19世纪末20世纪处的哦，所以有些词条的英语解释还是要格外注意的，可能个别会和现代英语略有差别。	<br><br>
这三套教材各有优缺点，看你怎么选择啦~~  学完基础语法尽快阅读文本才是王道，Cambridge Greek and Latin Texts 那套绿黄本还是非常强大的，强烈建议买版权书，读起来很有感觉，每天2小时~~ 一本读上一个学期，难一点的一个学年，够了。比较简单的是荷马，希罗多德，但是Ionic,所以有些语法和Attic略有不同，不过多读点习惯就好了，词汇大于句法，再往后可以读柏拉图，经典的Attic, 最难的嘛，读修昔底德，读修昔底德让你体验到希腊人的脑容量有多么大！哥对戏剧，演说辞不熟，悲剧读过一点点选段，戏剧不记得读过，不好多说~~	<br><br>
就写这些最重要的啦，哥要看书了哦，希望对那些自学的学弟学妹们有所帮助！（个人觉得，中国学生学习古希腊语，还是需要找个老师的~~） 	<br><br>


显示时间是2011-07-28 很久之前写的东西，都快忘记了，发现现在有人阅读，很意外，很惊喜。	<br><br>
旧文有个错误，更正：Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics,所谓剑桥绿黄本。	<br><br>
提到的几本教材、参考书是我自己的学习经历和习惯了，更外一本语法书Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek 应该也很不错，我的经验教训是，多读多读！	<br><br>
Good luck!	<br><br>

同样学会阿提卡古希腊语也不一定看懂新约希腊语。因为新约中有很多奇奇怪怪的词，古典希腊文献中是不会用的。	<br><br>
那年我在加拿大学古希腊语 	<br><br>
作者：□张红    时间：2009-03-16 	<br><br>
王柯平，1955年生，陕西人，中国社会科学院哲学研究所研究员。	<br><br>
其实早在1992年，王柯平在洛桑大学哲学系研习博士课程“艺术哲学”时，就有学习古希腊语的打算了。当时，他想作关于尼采艺术哲学方面的研究。导师告诉他，如果想作尼采研究，就应该先去学学古希腊语。因为尼采最早就是希腊的古典语言学者。	<br><br>
在导师的建议下，王柯平决定学古希腊语，但是当时洛桑大学古希腊语的学习班，课程已经进行了一半，语法部分都是用法文解释，从中间学起要想跟上进度基本不可能，他的学习计划暂时搁浅。	<br><br>
几年之后，1998年，王柯平奔赴加拿大研修，成为多伦多大学东亚系的访问学者。多伦多大学圣麦克尔学院当时正好有一个讲授古希腊语的初级班，对他来说是个很好的学习机会，于是就想去旁听。他找到开课的老师，却被告知不能单纯旁听。如果想来听课，就得和其他选修这门课的正式学生一样，除了上课听讲，还要做课堂练习，课下要做作业，要按时交作业，期中、期末必须参加考试。最后，老师还郑重交待，要想学好古希腊语，平均每天必须要用10个小时来学习。王柯平听完要求，没犹豫就点了头。王柯平后来听说，像这种教授古希腊语的课，在美国纽约，一学期要收费3000美元，一学年就是6000美元，而他在多伦多上的这门课，是完全免费的，不免感慨自己的幸运。	<br><br>
然而钱还是要花一些的，他们上课用的教材要自己买，一本厚厚的《古希腊语初级教材》足有一公斤重，花了王柯平68加元。他去多伦多大学做访问学者，生活费是自己拿到的国家奖学金，当时奖学金一个月是800加元，每月房租是480加元，所以花68加元买一本书对于王柯平来说，真是不算少了。他说：“当时买书主要是在旧书店淘选，省一点钱还想到美国等地旅游，这次咬咬牙，就把教材一起买下了。因为在此前，也花了近乎同样的数额买了《柏拉图对话全集》。”	<br><br>
王柯平就这样成为班上的一名“旁听的正式学生”，学期初时班上共25个人，来自世界各国，他是唯一的中国人。这门课一周上两次，一次上3个小时。古希腊语是一种很难学习的语言，即便是希腊人自己学习，除了发音方面的优势，基本没有其他优势。如当初老师告诉他的，他每天果然要用10个小时，才能消化掉课堂上的内容和完成老师布置的作业。	<br><br>
如今说起那段学习古希腊语的时光，王柯平最念念不忘的，是那位教学态度认真、对学生要求严格的老师。这位老师在课堂上经常叫学生回答问题或是朗读课文；每次上完课，都会布置课后作业――把10个英文句子翻译成希腊文，把10个希腊文句子翻译成英文；他要求学生们的作业隔行写，并且只写一面，另一面空出来，隔行写有利于他在句下批改，空白的一面，让学生把他批改过的再抄一遍；每次批改作业之前，他会先检查上次学生的抄写情况，如果抄写仍有错误，就会让学生再抄一遍。	<br><br>
在多伦多大学的一年，王柯平除了选修柏拉图美学思想和佛教哲学思想两门课外，就是勤奋苦学古希腊语了。那时，生活因为学习古希腊语而变得紧张充实。每天，他忙着复习课堂上的内容，忙着翻译老师布置下的20个句子，忙着记词的变位。他感觉自己像一根上足了的发条，被古希腊语驱使着，根本停不下来，走着路嘴里也在念叨着希腊文的单词，随身带着纸和笔，一有空就要拿出来画画写写。	<br><br>
这边王柯平学得不亦乐乎，那边很多学生已经知难而退，纷纷放弃学习了。半个学期过去了，期中考试时，班上的学生由25个变成了9个；到期末考试时，由9个变成了4个。多伦多大学规定，如果想拿到英文专业的学士学位，必须要拿下一门古典语言――古希腊语或者拉丁语，这剩下的4个学生中，有两个就是要不得不拿下一门古典语言的学生。另外一个犹太学生，和王柯平一样，属于“旁听的正式学生”。学生人数依旧在减少，第二学期开学后，大家发现人又少了一个，那个必须要拿下一门古典语言的女生，或许还是觉得古希腊语太难，选择了放弃，去学拉丁语了。这剩下的3个学生，继续跟着老师学习，并坚持到了最后。	<br><br>
因为多伦多大学圣麦克尔学院有教会背景，老师上课时都穿着教士的黑色长袍。除了他的黑色长袍和认真严谨的教学态度给王柯平留下极深的印象外，他偶尔表现出的幽默也让王柯平每每回想起来都忍俊不禁。当全班只剩下3个人后，有次王柯平疑惑地问老师，学古典语言的人为什么这么少，老师回答：“不少了，去年班上最后只剩下一个人了。”因为多数大学老师拿的工资都和其所开课程的选修学生人数直接挂钩，所以有位希腊学生就问老师，这样会不会因此少拿工资。“当时老师看了我们一眼，大笑着说，‘我拿工资不靠选课学生的多少，如果靠选课学生的人数发工资的话，那我早就去跳脱衣舞了’。”王柯平回忆道。	<br><br>
王柯平说，第二学期因为只剩下3个学生，被老师提问到的频率就更高了，3个学生轮流着回答，很快就又轮到自己。而作为唯一来自中国的学生，为了不丢面子，也不能在课堂上表现很差劲，所以课前的准备工作就得做足。	<br><br>
“因为喜欢就没有压力。”当记者问到当时会不会感到很大的学习压力时，王柯平这样回答。他当年做的作业，一共5本，现在都还留着，以此用来记忆那段难忘的学习古希腊语的时光。	<br><br>
王柯平不觉得自己在学习语言方面有什么特别的天赋，但是他也说自己从来不觉得学外语很难。他一共学习过4种外语，英语、德语、法语和古希腊语。英语是他的强项，他本科时在北京第二外国语学院读的就是英语系，硕士研究生时是在澳大利亚堪培拉大学文学院读的英国文学，听说读写能力都很强，英文著作、译作甚丰。2000年在牛津大学做访问研究员时，还应牛津电视台之邀，在其“哲学特别节目”上做了一期“道家论无”。他在国内任教时，与本科生一起学过两年德语（第二外语）。不过他说：“当时还能勉强阅读简单的报刊文章。但如今，因使用频率偏低，多年来德语水平不进则退，这需要花专门时间去补习和提高。否则，当不了大用。”	<br><br>
除了古希腊语，王柯平还想讲的，是他学法语的经历。在1992年去瑞士洛桑大学之前，按照教育部出台的对公派留学生外语要求的新规定，必须要通过瑞士使馆组织的一个法语的笔试和口试，才能到瑞士去留学。所以，王柯平服从安排，在北京语言大学法语系出国部进修了一年法语。	<br><br>
到了瑞士的洛桑大学后，由于打下了比较坚实的法文基础，王柯平开始了大量的法文阅读。除了阅读法文版康德的《判断力批判》，尼采的《悲剧的诞生》等哲学书籍和中国古典小说的法译本之外，他还读了法文版的《圣经》。阅读《圣经》是为了周末去教会参加一些讨论。参加讨论的目的，不仅是为了提高自己的法语听力和交际能力，也是为了研究本身的需要。他说：“作西方研究，光靠读书本上的知识是不够的。如果读书，在国内也能读。 既然去了国外，有机会和当地人接触，就应该多和他们交流，在特定的生活氛围中，去体会和感悟他们的生活方式、生活态度，以及他们对物质和精神的追求、享用方式。一般说来，只有在现实生活的具体感受中，才有可能理解和体悟西方文化与思想的内在生命力。”	<br><br>
  很多人觉得古希腊语很难，主页要说，是的确实不容易。	<br><br>
如果你觉得拉丁文已经恶心到你了的话，或者说你没有学过拉丁文，或者说你甚至不知道除了英语以外的其它语言长什么样，那么学习希腊语对你而言将会是一个充满极限刺激挑战的事业。	<br><br>
当然，它还是要比梵语简单的，而且简单了一个能量级，至于这朵语言奇葩，以后主页将开文另做介绍。	<br><br>
想要学这门谈不上轻松的语言，当然需要有比较好的一本入门教材，此文也就着这一点来给大家做些小小的介绍。	<br><br>
如果你想学标准古典希腊文（一般而言就是雅典老巢的阿提卡方言啦）：	<br><br>
中文的教材，我都不太推荐。	<br><br>
周展：《古典希腊语教程》 	<br><br>
这本书主页买过，不得不说，作者是用自己的能力在编，但是它的结构实在太奇怪，一开始就介绍非常复杂的 词汇（全部，每个，至于怎么复杂，还是先不要说了……），这实在是只能起到打击信心的作用啊……另外，第二节课就开始讲柏拉图的原句，看上去这似乎“原汁原味”了，但是柏拉图的句子，难度实在太大，根本不适合在初级阶段拿出来学习，那种句子，看了只能让人生出厌离心，一点都生不起欢喜心，其实我觉得《名哲言行录》里面的句子就比较欢乐开怀，或者是圣经中的句子，那可就更大众了。	<br><br>
孙周兴：古希腊语简明教程 	<br><br>
这本书节选自一本德文教材 ，承蒙我的希腊文老师，得以复印到它和它的教师用书。孙老本以翻译海德格尔出名，在没看到他的这个希腊文教材选本之前，主页对他充满了无限的敬仰，但是看到这本书之后则不得不有些莫名地要打折扣了。这本书本来就是给德国的中学生（我猜是Gymnasium文法中学）使用的教材，是植根于西方文化的，这种情况下，这个教科书对于中国的初学者来说，起点无疑有些高了，而且这种教学模式并不适合自学者。	<br><br>
刘小枫《凯若斯》	<br><br>
听过刘老师一个学期《会饮》篇的讲解，怎么也算得上是他的弟子了。不得不说，《凯若斯》作为一本希腊语文学读本编得非常好，可以让你品味到阅读原汁原味希腊语的无尽快感，作为一个有内部特供修订版+文法笺注的人来说，这更是幸福的不得了――但是很遗憾，这只是对那些把语法已经学得差不多的人而言如此――如果你打算零基础用这本书（自）学的话，那你只能摔得伤痕累累――你可以在一开始就看到各地方言，看到不定过去式中动态命令式奇葩的“认识你自己” （在第四课，拉丁语的cognosce te ipsum简直弱爆爆爆爆爆了！）	<br><br>
但是英文的教材却有很多不错的这里先推荐一本：	<br><br>
 "From Alpha to Omega" is an introduction to the classical Greek of Athens (Attic). 	<br><br>
From Alpha to Omega，可以说，是它让我觉得希腊语是如此简单，有趣，好玩而有规律。	<br><br>
这本书有什么好的呢？	<br><br>
1）单词量超小。	<br><br>
很多人觉得英文很难，为什么？因为他们从小到大一直在背单词！如果从初一到大四，我们一共只学五百个单词，还有人会觉得英语难吗？	<br><br>
因此一本适合中国人，特别是自学者的教材最重要的一点就是单词少，少，少！	<br><br>
这本书五十课，单词甚至五百个都不到，非常好背。	<br><br>
2）语法讲解非常详细，而又不会有多余的废话。	<br><br>
每一个诡异的变格变位下面都会有长串的说明，告诉你这些特殊形式是怎么出现的，原形本该如何，如此等等，读完有醍醐灌顶之效	<br><br>
3）体系规整，检索方便	<br><br>
如果你之前学过韦洛克，那么你会发现这本书完全仿照了韦洛克的结构，让你读起来非常有亲切感，而且一点也不会感到困难，如果你忘记了某些词的形式，可以极其迅速地在书中检索到，所以我对此书一直爱不释手。	<br><br>
不要吐槽主页记的笔记，那个是……因为……老师上课讲了，我就手多地记了下来……而已啦！！	<br><br>
还有，记得像主页那样写作业喔~	<br><br>

From Alpha to Omega: A Beginning Course in Classical Greek Paperback  C May 1, 2013 	<br><br>
by Anne H. Groton   (Author)	<br><br>
Greek belongs to a large and colorful family of Indo-European languages, all thought to be descended from a very old, now extinct language spoken by people who roamed over the Eurasian continent during prehistoric times. Other prominent members of the family are the Italic (including Latin and the Romance languages), Germanic (including English), Celtic, Baltic, Slavic (including Russian), Armenian, Iranian, and Indic languages.	<br><br>
The Greek language has been in continuous use for more than three thousand years; its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have been evolving gradually over the centuries. There is a great deal of difference between, say, Greek of the seventh century BCE and Greek of the first century CE, even though they are both “ancient” from our point of view. Moreover, each geographical region of Greece had its own dialect. Some authors wrote in their native dialect; others, working within an established literary genre, wrote in the dialect(s) that tradition demanded.	<br><br>
Attic, the dialect of the Athenians.  	<br><br>
 The ancient Greek taught in this book is Classical in date. It is the sort of Greek that would have been used by educated people during Greece’s Classical age, roughly the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. These were glory days for Athens, artistically and intellectually as well as militarily. Much of the literature surviving from the Classical period is written in Attic, the dialect of the Athenians. (Attica is the name of the district that includes Athens.) The philosopher Plato, the orators Lysias and Demosthenes, the historians Thucydides and Xenophon, the comic playwright Aristophanes―to name just a few of Athens’ most famous authors―all wrote in Attic.	<br><br>

I'm very impressed with this grammar. Morwood makes no claims that he is replacing Smyth's grammar for breadth. Instead, the Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek sets out in a very consise and clear manner various paradigms and rules. I particularly appreciate the VERY good verb section - not only providing paradigms for the regular conjugations and types of verbs, but also giving the principle parts of the 100 most common irregular verbs. For someone (like myself) who can never seem to remember all of the irregular verbs that seem to pop up in translations FAR too often, this grammar will become a favorite resource. My only complaint -- I'm sure that my grammar skills have declined as a result of relying upon this book rather than my memory during translations.	<br><br>

Being a small book, I can take it with me everywhere, and repeat the Greek grammar. Whenever I translate something from Greek and I have problems with a grammatical form, I look into this easy to search book and I usually find a solution to my problem. Of course, this happens when I don't have time to look into bigger and more profound grammars like the ones written by Smith, Goodwin etc. But, as the author says, this Oxford grammar is based on Smith. I recommend this book especially to those who want to repeat the essentials of the accidence and syntax of Ancient Greek.<br><br>

it does not contain an answer key to the problems. Morwood sets an nice steady course for the beginning student.<br><br>

I always wondered why no one had ever produced a Greek Primer to rival Kennedy's Latin Primer: well-laid out;precise and complete. At last they have! This is the first Grammar produced in almost a 100 years and does not dissapoint. the paradigms are well laid out,the finer points of Greek Grammar are demistyfied, and the sections well organized and easy to follow. There are tables of the most common irregular verbs.<br><br>
There is a brief English Greek, Greek English vocablary, and some exercises, useful, but you should not buy this Grammar for these added features, you should buy it because it is the best intermediate reference grammar available<br><br>

Kennedy's Latin books have acquired a firm place in English culture: They are not simply excellent textbooks on the Latin language but are symbols of what schoolchildren have endured and enjoyed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. ----- Even thought this famous book is being brought to you in a new edition it remains complete and includes extra material from Kennedy's other grammar books. ---- These books provide clear and simple explanations of written and spoken Latin. Comprehensive and easy to use with coverage of all the key points of Latin grammar, the shorter primer is the ideal learning tool for the beginner in Latin. ---- Intermediate students should use the second book Kennedy's Revised Latin Primer also published by Simon Wallenberg. While a third book, Kennedy's Public school grammar will also show you in greater detail, how the Latin language works. ---- "For over a hundred years Kennedy's textbooks have been the unrivalled books for the teaching of the Latin language in public schools. The new Wallenberg edition will be welcomed by students and teachers alike." --- Telegraph Online Newspaper<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">History</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Georgetown University is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher learning in the United States. John Carroll’s founding of Georgetown College coincides with the birth of our nation. In 1789, Carroll secured the deed to 60 acres of land on a hilltop overlooking the village of Georgetown. He was appointed Archbishop of Baltimore in 1808.
<br><br>
Classes began in 1792. Within the first year, attendance grew to more than 40 students, from as far away as the West Indies. In 1817, the school awarded its first two bachelor’s degrees.
<br><br>
Becoming Blue and Gray<br><br>

The Civil War (1861-1865) nearly closed Georgetown, as the student body dropped from 313 to 17 between 1859 and 1861. A total of 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in the war, serving in both the Union and Confederate forces.
<br><br>
After the Second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in 1862, several campus buildings were turned into a temporary hospital. To celebrate the end of the Civil War, Georgetown students selected the colors blue (Union) and gray (Confederate) as the school’s official colors in 1876.<br><br>

Expanding Education<br><br>

Georgetown established the School of Medicine in 1851 and the Law School in 1870. Patrick F. Healy, S.J., the university’s president between 1873 and 1882, was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. and the first to head a major U.S. university. Healy dramatically reformed the university’s curriculum with a new emphasis on history and the natural sciences and started construction on the Flemish Romanesque-style Healy Hall in 1877.
<br><br>
Joseph Havens Richards, S.J., president from 1888 to 1898, established graduate courses in the arts and sciences and built new facilities for the law and medical schools. The university’s expansion continued into the 20th century, with the opening of the School of Dentistry in 1901, School of Nursing in 1903 and the School of Foreign Service in 1919 under the direction of Edmund Walsh, S.J. The School of Dentistry closed in 1990.
<br><br>
As the new decade of post-war peace and prosperity took off in the early 1920s, Georgetown mirrored the nation’s period of growth prompting the construction of New North, Copley Hall, White-Gravenor Building and the Medical and Dental Building. By 1930, enrollment had nearly doubled, reaching 2,600.
<br><br>
The Great Depression was a period of great consolidation for Georgetown as enrollment fell below 2,000. Despite a time of economic hardship, President Arthur O’Leary, S.J., formally organized the Graduate School in the 1930s, offering programs in mathematics, the natural sciences, economics, history and government.
<br><br>
During World War II, the U.S. War Department designated Georgetown as one of a select number of universities to house the Army Specialized Training Program. More than 75 percent of students enrolled in the 1943-44 academic year were military service men. During the 1944-45 academic year, women were allowed to enroll in the School of Foreign Service.
<br><br>
The years after World War II saw another increase in enrollment and expansion of the university. Under the leadership of Edward Bunn, S.J. (1952-1964), Georgetown created the School of Business Administration in 1957, an outgrowth of the School of Foreign Service. Bunn is also responsible for creating the School for Summer and Continuing Education, now the School for Continuing Studies, in the 1950s.
<br><br>
Across the nation, the 1960s were shaped by the emergence of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval. Georgetown students were on campus when the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy took place. The women’s movement began to take hold, and women were accepted to the College for the first time in 1969. 
<br><br>Students demonstrated against the Vietnam War in the 1970s, causing some disruptions to classes and campus life. By the end of the decade, most of the anger and discontent had been redirected into positive social action. Students started an annual tradition of spending their Spring Break helping underprivileged communities outside of Washington, D.C., a program that Georgetown students continue to take part in.The 1980s were a time of tremendous growth on campus with the completion of Yates Field House and the opening of the Bunn Intercultural Center, new residence halls, and the $51 million Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center for students. During the university’s bicentennial year (1988-89), U.S. President Ronald Reagan provided the opening address to kick off the yearlong celebration, the culmination of which included a reunion ball with over 3,500 guests at D.C.’s Union Station. The 1980s also began a “golden age” in two traditional sports at Georgetown, basketball and track. Under coaches John Thompson Jr. and Frank Gagliano, basketball and track enjoyed unprecedented periods of success from the early 1980s well into the 1990s.
<br><br>Under the leadership of Rev. Timothy Healy, S.J., (1976-1989) and Rev. Leo O’Donovan, S.J.,(1989-2001) Georgetown saw significant increases in the diversity of its students and faculty, and the number of faculty positions as it grew from a regional school to one of national prominence. Women also greatly increased their numbers within the faculty during the nineties making up nearly 40 percent by 2001. O’Donovan also oversaw the restructuring of the Medical Center and the separation of the hospital from the medical school. In 2001, John J. DeGioia, Ph.D. became Georgetown’s 48th, and first lay president.
<br><br>Georgetown Today
<br><br>Georgetown has grown to be a major international research university with eight schools, an affiliated hospital and many highly ranked academic programs. Today the university has more than 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students who take classes at five locations: Main Campus, Medical Center, Law Center, GU-Northern Virginia and the university’s School of Foreign Service-Qatar. Georgetown has a large and diverse workforce that employs more than 5,000 faculty and staff members. Under the leadership of President John J. DeGioia, Georgetown has seen rapid growth and expansion, including the addition of several residence halls and the new, state-of-the-art Rafik B. Hariri Building for the business school. Georgetown continues to move forward as one of the world’s leading universities, building upon its distinctive history, unique values and commitment to justice and the common good.

	<b><a name="T9">Jesuit & Catholic Identity</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Georgetown is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institute of higher learning in the United States. Jesuits have played a significant role in the growth and evolution of Georgetown into a global research university deeply rooted in the Catholic faith. Georgetown’s Jesuit tradition also promotes the university’s commitment to spiritual inquiry, civic engagement, and religious and cultural pluralism. The Jesuits are members of the Society of Jesus, an international religious community which was founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in the 16th century. Today, Jesuits continue to enrich the university through their work as scholars, researchers, administrators, chaplains and counselors.	<br><br>
Identity and Mission	<br><br>
The ideals and principles that have characterized Jesuit education for over 450 years are central to Georgetown’s mission and character. Drawing from this tradition, Georgetown fosters an environment where students can develop their unique gifts and insights through reflection, service and intellectual inquiry. Students are challenged to engage in the world and become men and women in the service of others, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of the community. These values are at the core of Georgetown’s identity, binding members of the community across diverse backgrounds, faiths, cultures and traditions.	<br><br>
Academic Discourse and Spiritual Enrichment	<br><br>
Catholicism’s rich and diverse intellectual tradition is central to Georgetown’s academic life. The university serves as a forum where issues of importance to society and the Church are considered in a spirit of mutual respect and dialogue. Students have opportunities for reflection and discussion on Catholic thought and teaching through academic coursework and programs, religious services, retreats, residence life programs and campus ministry efforts. In keeping with the Catholic and Jesuit commitment to engage people of all faiths, Georgetown hosts and sponsors rich academic and cultural programs in interreligious dialogue, and the university’s Office of Campus Ministry offers students, faculty and staff the opportunity to worship within their respective traditions.	<br><br>
A Commitment to Faith 	<br><br>
Grounded in the belief that spiritual development is essential to personal growth, St. Ignatius placed prayer and reflection at the center of Jesuit life. Today, Georgetown celebrates this long tradition by providing pastoral care and opportunities for worship, reflection and service to members of the community across a diversity of faiths. On any given week, more than 50 different religious services are taking place across our campuses, including Catholic Masses, Muslim prayer services, Orthodox Christian services, Jewish Shabbat services, and Protestant services and Bible studies.	<br><br>

A Call to Service	<br><br>
The Church’s commitment to social justice and the Jesuit mission to create leaders in the service of others underscore many intellectual and spiritual pursuits at the university. Through scholarship and service, Georgetown students, faculty and staff work together to help solve some of the world’s most pressing problems C including poverty, disease and conflict.	<br><br>

Dr. John J. DeGioia<br><br>

Welcome and thank you for your interest in Georgetown University. Georgetown has stood on the banks of the Potomac River overlooking the nation's capital for more than two centuries. In a city where the lessons of history come alive, students and faculty examine the modern world in its infinite complexity. Few settings offer greater intellectual, political or cultural resources.<br><br>

Under the guidance of renowned scholars, Georgetown students immerse themselves in the realm of ideas. Our Catholic and Jesuit heritage invites the Georgetown community to take that exploration to an even deeper level. Our students are encouraged not only to study but also to reflect, and through an understanding of the world, prepare for lives of leadership and service.<br><br>

This is an exciting time to be at Georgetown, whether you are a prospective student, a graduate or a parent.  I hope you will have an opportunity to visit the campus and discover the Georgetown spirit for yourself.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Executive Committee	<br><br>
The Executive Committee serves as the Board’s primary advisory body to the President and is empowered by the Bylaws to act on behalf of the Board when necessary. The Committee also deals with issues of major policy as they may arise from time to time and, working with the President and Board Chair, helps oversee the development of agendas for Board meetings. The Executive Committee’s Subcommittee on Compensation conducts an annual evaluation of the President and determines the President’s compensation level; reviews the recommendations of and advises the President on compensation levels for senior University administrators; reviews and advises on individual contracts which include provisions above and beyond the scope of the University’s base compensation and benefits structures, as well as contracts subject to the federal “intermediate sanctions” law; and ensures that the philosophy behind, and strategies to implement, the University’s compensation level are effective, reasonable, and fair.	<br><br>
The Executive Committee also discusses the University’s tolerance for risk with management. In addition, the Executive Committee reviews management’s identification of enterprise risks and exposures and either retains oversight of such risks or assigns oversight to the Board or other Committees of the Board. With respect to the risks for which it retains oversight, the Executive Committee performs the following oversight activities: reviews and discusses with management the specific, significant risks and exposures facing the University; and assesses the adequacy of management’s actions to manage those risks.	<br><br>

SECTION 9. Standing Committees of the Board of Directors	<br><br>
(1) Standing Committees. The standing committees of the Board of Directors shall be the Executive Committee and the Committee on Medical Center Affairs. In addition, the Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors in office, may designate and appoint members to one or more other standing committees, each of which shall consist of three (3) or more Directors, which committees, to the extent provided in said resolution or in these Bylaws, shall exercise the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the affairs of the University. Such resolution shall designate one Director who is a member of the standing committee to serve as Chair of the committee; may prescribe the functions, duties, and powers of standing committees; and may dissolve standing committees. The designation and appointment of any such standing committee and the delegation thereto of power and authority shall not operate to relieve the Board of Directors, or any individual Director, of any responsibility imposed on it or upon the Director by law. By resolution adopted by a majority of the members of any standing committee and approved by the Executive Committee, a standing committee may constitute one or more subcommittees. Only members of a standing committee may serve as members of a subcommittee of that standing committee. Each subcommittee shall have not less than three members and shall have a chair appointed by the chair of the standing committee. The committee resolution constituting the subcommittee may specify that the subcommittee shall exist for a specified term of months or years or until the completion of a discrete task or assignment.	<br><br>

The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors present at any meeting, may designate and appoint members to one or more special committees or task forces. The resolution authorizing the establishment of a special committee or task force may specify that the special committee or task force shall exist for a specified term of months or years or upon the completion of a discrete task or assignment.	<br><br>
(3) Members. Unless he or she resigns, dies, or is removed prior thereto, each member of a standing committee, special committee, or task force (collectively referred to hereinafter as "committee") shall continue to hold office until the annual meeting of the Board of Directors and until a successor has been designated. The resignation of a committee member must be in writing and shall be effective upon the date of receipt thereof by the Secretary of the Board of Directors or upon the effective date specified therein, whichever date is later, unless acceptance is made a condition of the resignation, in which event it shall be effective upon acceptance by the Board. Any committee member may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by a majority vote of the whole Board of Directors.	<br><br>
(4) Meetings; Quorum; Minutes. A majority of the full membership of a committee may determine its action and may fix the time and place of its meetings, unless provided otherwise by these Bylaws or by resolution of the Board of Directors. Regular meetings of a committee may be held without notice at such time and place as the committee shall determine. Special meetings of a committee shall be called by the Secretary of the Board of Directors at the request of the President, or by any two members of the committee in question. Notice of each special meeting shall be given by the Secretary of the Board of Directors to each committee member. No such notice of any given meeting need be given to any member who attends the meeting or who delivers or telegraphs a written waiver of notice thereof to the Secretary of the Board of Directors, either before or after the meeting. The Board of Directors shall have the power at any time to fill vacancies in, to change the size or membership of, and to discharge or abolish any such committee. A quorum for the transaction of business at a committee meeting shall consist of a majority of the members of the committee then in office. If the Board has not designated alternate members of the committee, or if all such alternates are absent or disqualified, the members of such committee present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may in the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of such absent or disqualified member. Each committee shall keep a written record of its acts and proceedings and shall submit that record to the Board of Directors at each regular meeting and at other times as requested by the Board of Directors. Failure to submit the record, or failure of the Board of Directors to approve any action indicated therein will not, however, invalidate the action to the extent it has been carried out by the University prior to the time the record of such action was, or should have been, submitted to the Board of Directors as provided above.	<br><br>
(5) The Committee on Medical Center Affairs. Subject to, and in accordance with, the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, the Board of Directors shall, upon nomination by the Executive Committee, appoint a Committee on Medical Center Affairs of nine (9) or more members, two members of which shall be the President of the University (who shall serve as a voting member) and the Executive Vice President for Health Sciences (who shall serve as a non-voting member), and the remaining members of which shall be Directors or other individuals deemed appropriate for nomination by the Chairman of the Board in consultation with the University President. The Board shall designate one Director who is a member of the Committee on Medical Center Affairs to serve as Chair of the Committee. Subject only to the authority vested in the Board of Directors by the Charter of the University and Bylaws of the Board, and except as specifically provided in this subparagraph, the Committee on Medical Center Affairs shall have and may exercise the powers and authority of the Board of Directors with regard to the Georgetown University Medical Center and its schools, departments, hospitals and other health care facilities, centers, operating components, subdivisions, and related activities, including but not limited to: 	<br><br>

The Committee on Medical Center Affairs shall be understood to be and shall function as a standing committee of the Board of Directors under the Charter of the University and Bylaws of the Board. The Committee on Medical Center Affairs shall make regular and complete reports of its proceedings to the President of the University and shall report to the Board of Directors no less frequently than at the Board's regularly scheduled meetings.	<br><br>
The Committee on Medical Center Affairs may, by resolution adopted by the Committee and approved by the Board, establish an executive subcommittee consisting of not less than three Committee members, one of whom shall be the President of the University and one of whom shall be the chair of the Committee. The other members of the executive subcommittee shall be nominated by the chair of the Committee and appointed for terms of one year. The members of the executive subcommittee shall be eligible for renomination and reelection. The chair of the Committee on Medical Center Affairs shall be ex officio chair of the executive subcommittee with right to vote.	<br><br>
Unless otherwise determined by resolution, the executive subcommittee shall have full power to take all action which the Committee is authorized to take, including actions without meeting as specified in Article II, Section 11 of these Bylaws.	<br><br>
The executive subcommittee shall meet at the call of the chair of the Committee. Notice of all meetings of the executive subcommittee shall be given in the same way as notice of all meetings of committees. No such notice of any given meeting need be given to any member of the executive subcommittee who attends the meeting or who delivers or telegraphs a written waiver of notice thereof to the Secretary of the Board of Directors, either before or after the meeting. The Committee on Medical Center Affairs shall have the power at any time to fill vacancies in the executive subcommittee, but the Committee shall not have the power to change the size or membership of or to discharge or abolish any such executive subcommittee except by resolution approved by the Committee and the Board.	<br><br>
A quorum for the transaction of business at an executive subcommittee meeting shall consist of a majority of the members of the executive subcommittee then in office. The executive subcommittee shall keep a written record of its acts and proceedings and shall submit that record to the Committee at each regular committee meeting and at other times as requested by the chair of the Committee. Failure to submit the record, or failure of the Committee to approve or ratify any action indicated therein will not, however, invalidate the action to the extent it has been carried out by the University prior to the time the record of such action was, or should have been, submitted to the Committee as provided above.	<br><br>
SECTION 10. The Executive Committee	<br><br>
(1) Membership. The Executive Committee shall comprise such number of Directors as shall, from time to time, be determined by the Board.

ARTICLE IV: UNIVERSITY SEAL	<br><br>
The emblem for the institution was designed and executed near the end of the eighteenth century, some ten years after the founding of the academy.

The artist is unknown.	<br><br>

SECTION 2. Notice and Waiver of Notice	<br><br>
Whenever notice is required to be given by law, by the Charter or by these Bylaws, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice, but such notice, except as heretofore otherwise provided, or as otherwise provided by law, may be given by depositing the same in a post office, letter box or mail chute, in a post-paid sealed wrapper addressed to the Director, Officer or Member of the Corporation, as the case may be, at such address as appears on the books of the Corporation. Notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors may be given as hereinbefore provided in Section 6 of Article II.	<br><br>
No notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting of Members of the Corporation or Directors, whether prescribed by law, by the Charter or by the Bylaws, need be given to any Member of the Corporation who attends in person, or to any Director who attends in person, or to any Member of the Corporation or Director who, in writing, executed and filed with the records of the meeting either before or after the holding thereof, waives such notice.	<br><br>
SECTION 3. Indemnification.	<br><br>
(a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other (other than an action authorized by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors) by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such suit, action or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful except the Corporation shall not indemnify any such person in relation to matters as to which he shall be adjudged in a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty as a director or officer. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgement, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create any presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or acted negligently or was guilty of misconduct in performance of a duty, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.	<br><br>
(b) Expenses incurred by an officer or director in defending a civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section.	<br><br>
(c) To the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in the Section or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.	<br><br>
(d) Any indemnification under this Section (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Section. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.	<br><br>
(e) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.	<br><br>
(f) The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section.	<br><br>
(g) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of Members or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.	<br><br>

The Opportunity	<br><br>
Georgetown University is seeking an individual of significant accomplishment, recognized stature and compelling public presence to serve as dean of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) as the School approaches its centennial. Confidential inquiries, nominations and applications are invited.	<br><br>
Founded in 1919, SFS is a premier school of international affairs. The School’s graduate programs are ranked first and its undergraduate programs ranked fifth in the world in the most recent survey conducted by Foreign Policy. QS ranks Georgetown University 14th in the world for its programs in politics and international studies. SFS provides a rigorous, liberal-arts-based education that combines theory and practice and instills the values of service. Coursework is supplemented by mentorship from exceptionally accomplished international relations professionals, including many SFS alumni. A campus of SFS in Qatar was established in 2005.	<br><br>
Georgetown is one of the world’s most highly regarded universities, preparing the next generation of global citizens to make a difference in the world. This is a dynamic period for the University, with a variety of new institutional initiatives. Provost Robert Groves, appointed in 2012, is leading the process of reexamining a wide range of institutional practices; many of those new directions are reflected in the provost’s blog. Similarly, within SFS there is the opportunity to work closely with faculty and students to reexamine the work that has made SFS so successful, and to consider new approaches that can further strengthen the position of SFS as a leader in 21st-century international affairs, education and research. The SFS dean reports directly to the provost.	<br><br>
The SFS dean will have several key roles, including articulating a compelling vision and strategy for ensuring the School’s leadership among the very best schools of international affairs, identifying opportunities to further enhance educational programs, strengthening relationships with Georgetown’s Qatar campus, and facilitating expanded collaborations between SFS and other Georgetown schools.	<br><br>
The ideal candidate will be both an accomplished scholar who has worked in universities and understands academic culture, and a highly regarded practitioner in international relations who brings the relationships and insights that derive from that experience. It is understood that not every candidate will bring strength in every area. A term appointment or a tenured faculty appointment will be considered, depending on qualifications.	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T19">Georgetown College </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Founded in 1789 as the nation’s first Catholic institution of higher learning, Georgetown College is committed to the Jesuit traditions of an integrated education and of productive research in the liberal arts, including fine arts, humanities, languages, sciences, and social sciences.<br><br>

Georgetown College is defined by intellectual curiosity and spiritual vitality. Our commitment to academic excellence in the liberal arts combined with our inclusive Catholic and Jesuit values for social justice, our international outlook, and an advantageous position in vibrant Washington, DC, create a unique undergraduate experience.<br><br>

ACADEMICS AND ADVISING<br><br>

We believe in the Jesuit ideal of cura personalis: education of the whole person, and we welcome you to learn more about the dynamic and thoughtful education that the College provides. Students explore the College curriculum through core requirements, leading them to an eventual concentration of study.<br><br>

The College also provides a three-tiered advising structure for students, including advising deans, faculty advisors, and peer advisors. Students receive advising from the dean’s office throughout their four years at Georgetown, in addition to a faculty advisor in their major. First-year students have the opportunity to get to know faculty through unique, small course offerings, including the Ignatius and Liberal Arts seminars.<br><br>
Undergraduate Education in the Jesuit Tradition<br><br>

As a Jesuit college, Georgetown College draws on a dynamic tradition of education, characterized by an optimistic Christian humanism and commitment to responsibility and social action. Accordingly, the College seeks to encourage the development of critical powers, respect for tradition and human reason, and an appreciation of life and all its endeavors.
<br><br>
We promote not only the intellectual disciplines but also the search for personal values and convictions that will enable graduates to continue redefining and maturing their thought, and also to continue pursuing the integration of their activities, values, and relationships with others.<br><br>

The College begins the pursuit of these goals through a diverse set of core requirements. No area of human experience is unimportant to the formation of informed and compassionate citizens. The skills and strategies that students acquire inform their choice of major, allow for a depth of experience in the discipline, and provide the best foundation for a personally productive life.<br><br>

Shiloh Krupar, Field Chair; Anthony Pirrotti, Curricular Dean 	<br><br>
CULP is an intellectually rigorous program that enables students to engage with questions of culture, knowledge, and power. Students will gain a complex understanding of these terms, their histories, and effects. We approach politics as mediated by cultural practices, and culture as suffused with power. Power is embedded in institutions and the social order, and conditions individual and collective action.	<br><br>
Since no single approach encompasses the relation between culture and politics, the CULP major stresses fluency in different theories, definitions, and genres of culture. Different analytical tools from a variety of fields allow students to practice critical self-reflection, understand the politics of interpretation, and enhance their theoretical sophistication.	<br><br>
CULP fosters an environment for critical inquiry, creative engagement, and collaborative learning. All majors take the foundational course, Theorizing Culture and Politics, and then go on to choose their own five-course sequence around their individually chosen concentration, in addition to three courses each from the social sciences and the humanities. The high degree of flexibility afforded to students requires them to become independent agents of knowledge capable of designing their own program of studies according to their individual interests and talents.	<br><br>
Goals of the Major	<br><br>
The CULP major is designed to provide students with a complex understanding of the relationship between culture, knowledge, and power. It aims to provide students with theoretical frameworks and analytical skills that enhance cross-cultural tolerance, social justice, and ethical leadership, in order to make a difference in a world marked by power hierarchies and cultural conflicts. Students learn to apply analytical tools from multiple fields as they practice critical reflection on self and society, and enhance their analytic sophistication through collaborative problem solving.	<br><br>
The CULP major offers great individual flexibility. Students build a rigorous foundation for their studies through an in-depth gateway course that stresses fluency in a variety of theories, definitions, and genres of culture. Students then go on to assemble their own course sequence around individually chosen concentrations, in consultation with their mentor or dean. All students are expected to master the analytical methods and skills necessary to become thoughtful, rigorous readers and writers of scholarship on cultural power relations in the international arena.	<br><br>
CULP students are actively involved in publishing their own scholarship, linking up with such Georgetown programs as the Center for Justice and Peace and the Mortara Center for events and speakers; student groups such as the Critical Theory Society; and utilizing the rich cultural and social resources of Washington, DC.	<br><br>
Objectives of the Major 	<br><br>
The contemporary world is characterized by extensive cultural contacts that enhance connections, but also pose new challenges to acting responsibly and sensitively to the unfamiliar. Cultural competence and diplomacy are central to the peaceful functioning of a global system marked by deep, historically grown inequalities. Preparing students to treat opposing viewpoints and experiences with respect, CULP fosters a sophisticated and informed understanding of cultural diversity and the politics of identity. To prepare students for unforeseen conflicts and opportunities, they will be educated to do the following:	<br><br>
Identify, compare, and synthesize the key concepts and scholarly research in cultural and social theory across multiple disciplines―including history, anthropology, sociology, geography, literature, music, performing arts, film and new media, visual studies―that address the connections between power, culture, and identity.	<br><br>
Explicate, evaluate, and critique cross-cultural political issues, dynamics, and events in clear, concise writing.	<br><br>
Recognize multiple perspectives and dimensions of cultural interactions, and apply critical frameworks to competing claims to rights and recognition.	<br><br>
Develop the substantive, analytical and ethical skills necessary to question stereotypical, polarizing, and essentialist views of difference, as a precondition for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the domestic and international realm.	<br><br>
Understand and apply an expansive concept of culture that empowers ordinary people, organizations, and institutions as agents of change.	<br><br>
Students in the Honors program will further develop these abilities and their research and writing skills, and will produce theses comparable in quality and depth to many Master’s theses.	<br><br>
Writing in the Culture and Politics Major 	<br><br>
The Culture and Politics major develops students’ writing skills in the gateway course Theorizing Culture and Politics, as well as in upper-division courses that provide opportunities for conducting and presenting original research.  Some eligible CULP majors opt to write an Honors Thesis that proposes an original research question, surveys the existing literature on a topic related to culture and politics, and matches the appropriate methodology (quantitative or qualitative) to the research project.	<br><br>
Because CULP is an interdisciplinary major, there is not one methodology or genre that students must master.  The self-designed concentration may require a combination of discipline-specific methodologies that may be housed in the School of Foreign Service or the College.  The gateway course teaches the fundamentals of strong academic writing, which progresses from summarizing, and comparing and contrasting, to evaluating primary sources (be they cultural artifacts, historical texts, or theoretical writings).  Through carefully scaffolded assignments, students advance from primarily descriptive genres like the academic précis and the encyclopedia entry to more synthetic, interpretive papers.  These can range from analyzing a film or studying maps to providing historiographies or critical guided tours of specific places.  In addition, students learn to consider secondary sources that allow the writer to judge the merits of different viewpoints and position her or himself within a debate.  More advanced courses prepare students to generate research questions and devise plans to test and prove a hypothesis, in order to produce new knowledge.	<br><br>
Honors in the Major	<br><br>
(See http://bsfs.georgetown.edu/academics/honors/major/ for details about Honors)	<br><br>
The standards and expectations for honors-quality work are consistent with the ideal that students completing Honors in the Major are among the premier thinkers and writers at Georgetown.	<br><br>
Qualifications	<br><br>
In order to graduate with honors in Culture and Politics, a student must:	<br><br>
Earn a cumulative grade point average of 3.33 and a grade point average of 3.67 in the major by the date of graduation.	<br><br>
Submit, and gain approval for, a thesis proposal outlining the research project.	<br><br>
Successfully complete two semesters of tutorial work dedicated to preparation of the thesis.	<br><br>
Submit a senior thesis on an approved topic which is judged to be of honors quality by a faculty committee appointed for this purpose.	<br><br>
Application Deadline	<br><br>
Research proposals are due on Friday, March 14th by 5pm.  Thesis proposals may be submitted in person or by e-mail, fax or snail mail to Dean Gregory.  	<br><br>
Completed Theses Deadline	<br><br>
Completed honors theses are due by 5pm on April 15 of senior year.  	<br><br>
Defining a Culture and Politics Research Question	<br><br>
Consider a question that is centrally focused on the intersection of Culture and Politics (see our CULP Mission Statement).	<br><br>
Your research should make a meaningful contribution to our understanding of the relation of Culture and Politics.	<br><br>
For example choose a topic that you have discovered in scholarly literature which you want to explore in more detail, or a topic that emerges from theoretically sophisticated reflections on your own experiences.	<br><br>
Beginning with your initial proposal, you will need to be in regular conversation with your faculty mentor about your project. This may include periodic progress reports required by the CULP Honors Committee.	<br><br>
Define a clear and coherent theoretical framework in which to explore your topic. It is ideal if you have taken a social science research methods course prior to application.  If this is not possible, you will need to work closely with a faculty member to develop a coherent framework.	<br><br>
View a sample honors thesis proposal	<br><br>
Institutional Review Board Approval	<br><br>
If any part of your research design involves research involving other people (interviews, surveys, etc.) and you think that you might want to publish the results of this research in the future in an article, book, report, or other document that can be consulted by the general public, you must go through the IRB review process before your application.   http://ora.georgetown.edu/irb/	<br><br>
Tips for choosing a Faculty Mentor	<br><br>
Many professors do not respond to e-mail inquiries as quickly as students wish they would. Before you email a professor you have never met:	<br><br>
Develop a list of potential research questions (see "defining the question");	<br><br>
Read the professor's own work on the topic;	<br><br>
Identify sources you might utilize	<br><br>
To increase your chances of receiving a helpful and timely response, frame your initial message to a potential mentor with care.  You need to show that you have already given your thesis question thought, and are now looking to the professor for guidance.	<br><br>
Introduce yourself and explain why you are writing and how you discovered that this professor might be the right mentor for your project.	<br><br>
Outline your research question(s) and the reasoning behind them. If you know your proposed project will require special skills (language ability, experience with statistics, etc.) make sure to tell the professor that you possess them. If you have already drafted a proposal, include it.	<br><br>
Describe briefly the research you have already done.	<br><br>
Ask for specific information. Has this question already been answered in the literature? Are there enough resources locally to complete this project? Would it be better to approach this question from another angle? Does the professor have colleagues at Georgetown or elswhere who might be helpful?	<br><br>
Explain the timeline - ask if the professor could get back to you in a given time frame. You may want to offer to call the professor during office hours if a personal conversation would be more useful than an e-mail exchange. If you have only a few weeks to develop your proposal, acknowledge that you are starting late, and ask whether the professor would be able to read a draft and provide comments soon enough for you to submit the final proposal on time.	<br><br>
Do not expect the professor to agree to be your mentor until you have given him or her an actual proposal.	<br><br>
Shiloh Krupar is a Geographer and an Associate Professor of Culture and Politics in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. Her teaching and research interests, which span geography, architecture, performance studies, the medical humanities, and environmental justice, have explored several interrelated areas: military landscapes, such as decommissioned military sites and nuclear facilities; model cities and urban-environmental projects in China; cities in aftermath and the impacts of environmental, juridical, and financial disasters on the urban environment; and, lastly, biomedicine, specifically environmental biomonitoring, medical hot spotting, and medical geographies of waste. 	<br><br>
The recipient of a Quadrant Fellowship, her book Hot Spotter’s Report: Military Fables of Toxic Waste (University of Minnesota Press, 2013) explores the politics of nature conservation, environmental memory, contamination and compensation issues at decommissioned military sites in the western United States. She is currently working on one solo book project and two co-authored volumes: What Remains―The Unseen Medical Geographies of Waste; Museum of Waste: Capital, Ecology, Sovereignty (with C. Greig Crysler, University of California-Berkeley); and The Enterprise of Life (with Nadine Ehlers, University of Wollongong). 	<br><br>
Krupar has been published in such venues as Society and Space, Public Culture, Radical History Review, Liminalities, cultural geographies, and Progress in Human Geography. The 2012 SAGE Handbook of Architectural Theory includes her co-authored chapter (with Stefan Al, University of Pennsylvania) on theories of spectacle and branding. Her collaborative long-term art project “The National Toxic Land/Labor Conservation Service” (with Sarah Kanouse, University of Iowa) works at the intersection of art, research, and government policy to address the toxic afterlife of U.S. militarism and has been included in the Institute for Wishful Thinking (NYC, 2011), “Ecocultures” exhibition (George Mason University, 2011), Figure One Gallery (Champaign, IL, 2013), and is a Finalist in the traveling show "Monument to Cold War Victory" during 2014-16 (Cooper Union, NYC, October 2014; Wende Museum, Los Angeles, 2016). 	<br><br>
Krupar travels extensively to give lectures and performances, at the Royal Geographical Society in London, the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study’s workshop “Space, Power, Nation,” the Montreal-based Artivistic Conference “Un.Occupied Spaces,” and the annual meetings of the Association of American Geographers, American Studies Association, and the Society for Cultural Anthropology. 	<br><br>
As a member of the CULP core faculty, Professor Krupar teaches the courses “Theorizing Culture and Politics,” “Green Politics,” “Detouring the Global City,” “Introduction to Critical Geography,” and a variety of other offerings on cultures of exhibition, and landscape as an aesthetic object, political-economic artifact and social practice. She has worked collaboratively with The Phillips Collection to develop an institutional partnership and innovative new course on “Globalization, Diplomacy, and the Politics of Exhibitions.” 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T23">International Economics</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Rodney Ludema, Field Chair; Polly Robey, Curricular Dean	<br><br>
The International Economics (IECO) major is grounded in the belief that economic analysis is essential to the understanding of modern world affairs. With decreasing costs of transporting goods and information, market forces, which guide the international flow of goods, assets, people, technology, and information, are becoming a dominant factor in the process of globalization as well as in international conflicts. For example, when markets link countries, domestic policies such as subsidies and environmental regulation in one country affect the welfare of other countries. The integrating force of the market is redefining boundaries beyond those of the traditional nation state.	<br><br>
Economics is a social science that studies the behavior of social systems C such as markets, corporations, unions, international institutions, legislatures, and even families C through the lens of a unified analytical framework. That framework is built on the premise that individuals have goals and pursue those goals, subject to the constraints of resources, technology, and institutional setting. Thus, the focus is on the way individuals make decisions and how those decisions add up, and interact with one another, to produce the social systems we observe. Ultimately, economics offers insights into the study and design of policies to improve the performance of the system.	<br><br>
The applications of this approach to international issues are myriad, covering topics such as trade policy, international economic organizations, economic growth and development, international financial markets, financial crises, international migration, economic integration, international policy coordination, international political economy, transition to market economies, global environment and production standards, multinational corporations, international business and banking, and regional economies.	<br><br>
Because students receive rigorous training in quantitative techniques and objective analysis, a major in International Economics is excellent preparation for careers and leadership positions in the private or the public sector. Our students have been highly successful in areas such as finance, consulting, law, management, media, international development, international organizations, research institutes, government, non-profit organizations, and academia.	<br><br>
Goals of the Major	<br><br>
The International Economics major is designed to develop in students the ability to conduct innovative, well-informed, rigorous, quantitative analysis of all aspects of the world economy. Whether it is used in the service of business strategy, public policy, scientific research, or any other endeavor, this ability is essential to understanding the economic forces at work in the world and making sound decisions in the face of them. All students are expected to master the theoretical and empirical tools necessary to conduct such analysis. The major provides students with in-depth knowledge and opportunities for application in three main arenas in international economics:	<br><br>
International Economic Theory and Policy. This concentration delves deeper into the traditional areas economics and applications to economic policy, which, in addition to international economics, includes game theory, industrial organization, labor economics, public economics, development economics and macroeconomics.	<br><br>
International Commerce and Finance. The focus of this concentration is on practical applications of international economics in business and finance. The emphasis is on developing skills and institutional knowledge relevant to international commerce, investment and financial markets.	<br><br>
Economic Growth, Transition and Development. The focus of this concentration is on international economics as it pertains developing countries. It places greater emphasis on understanding the challenges faced by different regions and on strategies for economic development.	<br><br>
Students deepen their knowledge in these areas through in-depth subfield courses. They expand their knowledge by taking supporting courses in a wide range of specialized topics within each area.	<br><br>
Objectives of the Major	<br><br>
Economics is a social science that studies the behavior of social systems C such as markets, corporations, unions, international institutions, legislatures, and even families C through the lens of a unified analytical framework. The focus is on the way individuals make decisions and how those decisions add up, and interact with one another, to produce the social systems we observe. Ultimately, economics offers insights into the study and design of policies to improve the performance of the system. To understand and apply this approach, the student must learn the following:	<br><br>
The basic elements of microeconomic theory including consumer choice, the impact on resource allocation of different market structures, game theory, general equilibrium analysis, and asymmetric information.	<br><br>

Concentration Fields	<br><br>
The major in International Economics is organized into three subfields.	<br><br>
Subfield A: International Economic Theory & Policy 	<br><br>
This subfield is geared towards students who would like maximum exposure to economics, and is recommended to students who intend to study economics at the Ph.D. level.	<br><br>
Subfield B: International Finance & Commerce	<br><br>
This subfield is ideal for students interested in applying economics to business and finance, and is a good match with the International Business Diplomacy certificate.	<br><br>
Subfield C: Economic Growth, Transition & Development	<br><br>
This subfield is ideal for students interested in issues of economic development and transition, and matches well with area studies certificates.	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T24">SFS Mission and Vision</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The vision and mission of SFS have served the School well. The mission of the School of Foreign Service is
to provide students a rigorous education in international affairs that combines theory and practice and instills the values of service to others, offered by a faculty of outstanding scholars and practitioners who are committed to teaching, learning and discovery.<br><br>
SFS embodies the values and spirit of Georgetown University. A Catholic and Jesuit, student-centered research university, Georgetown educates women and men to be reflective lifelong learners, to be responsible and active participants in civic life and to live generously in service to others.<br><br>
The Georgetown maxim “Women and Men for Others” captures the worth placed on the development of both the character and outlook of Georgetown students; it reflects the University’s Jesuit character and permeates all areas of the University, including SFS.<br><br>
The vision of the School of Foreign Service is “to contribute to global peace, prosperity and human well-being by educating future generations of world leaders and expanding the knowledge, understanding and values that will inform their leadership.”<br><br>

	<b><a name="T25">The Evolution of SFS</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The School of Foreign Service was founded in 1919 as a direct response to the involvement of the United States in the First World War. "Having entered upon the stage of world politics and world commerce, we assume world-wide obligations. Our viewpoint can never be the same again," wrote Edmund A. Walsh, S.J., the School’s first dean. SFS predates the U.S. Foreign Service by six years, and has been a leader in international affairs from the beginning. SFS celebrates its hundredth anniversary in 2019. Deans of SFS are listed in Appendix I.<br><br>

Through the Cold War and beyond into the new global challenges of the 21st century, Georgetown continued to strengthen its core undergraduate and graduate degrees in foreign service, and founded major regional studies centers and more specialized MA programs to better meet its core missions. Today SFS offers one undergraduate and eight graduate-level masters programs, each considered a leader in its field.<br><br>

- Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service<br><br>
- Master of Science in Foreign Service<br><br>
- M.A. in Global Human Development<br><br>
- M.A. in Security Studies<br><br>
- M.A. in Arab Studies<br><br>
- M.A. in Asian Studies<br><br>
- M.A. in Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies<br><br>
- M.A. in German and European Studies<br><br>
- M.A. in Latin American Studies<br><br>
In the past two decades, SFS has substantially expanded the range and depth of academic study and teaching to encompass all of the main areas of global interactions and policy challenges. The seven undergraduate majors in the School today provide training in the central dynamics of international economics, politics, culture, and science and technology. At the masters level, outstanding interdisciplinary degree programs cover all of the key regions, from Latin America to the Arab world, as well as functional areas such as security, international development, and international affairs. These curricular developments have been matched by the creation of research centers that provide a platform for vibrant engagement across the campus and far beyond Georgetown's gates.<br><br>
The expansion of the breadth of knowledge generated by the SFS community has occurred alongside a significant increase in the academic quality of Georgetown faculty and the scholarly reputation of the School. Faculty across SFS are internationally recognized as leading academic researchers. Expectations for hiring and tenuring of faculty have risen over time, parallel to the steady climb in the rankings of Georgetown’s international affairs programs.<br><br>

In 2005, the University established the School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS-Q). The program has evolved and thrived in the decade since. The dean of SFS-Q currently reports jointly to the dean of SFS and to the University’s provost. The SFS-Q deans are listed in Appendix I.<br><br>
There are almost 50 faculty teaching on the Doha campus in Fall 2014, including six who are faculty at Georgetown in Washington (five based in the College and one based in SFS); the target of three Washington-based faculty serving in Doha each year has generally been met. The other SFS-Q faculty are recruited from around the world. Their disciplines include anthropology, Arabic, economics, French, history, philosophy, politics and international relations, religious studies and world literature. <br><br>

In light of Georgetown’s expanding offerings and with the encouragement of the leadership of the Qatar Foundation, general academic operations in Qatar eventually will become “Georgetown in Qatar” (just as the other institutions there are known by their institutions’ names, such as Northwestern in Qatar, Carnegie Mellon Qatar, and so on). SFS will still likely have the largest programs, but other programs will have the opportunity to flourish there as well. The new dean of SFS will be expected to take a substantial interest in the Doha campus, in order to continue the process of integrating the Doha programs into the life of SFS in Washington. The University’s 10-year contract with the Qatar Foundation is currently in the process of renewal; that process should be completed early in 2015.

	<b><a name="T26">Current Strengths and Challenges</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
At this critical moment, President John J. DeGioia and Provost Robert Groves bring an exceptionally strong conviction that the School is central to Georgetown University’s future. Just as the University is in a dynamic period of reexamination, SFS has the opportunity to reflect on its accomplishments and its future so as to sustain its extraordinary leadership in the field of international affairs, to ensure that SFS faculty, students and alumni continue to be leaders in a very dynamic world, and to create a new constellation of partners.<br><br>
The core strengths of SFS today include the following:<br><br>
- The explicit integration of a truly global perspective, the rigorous analysis of functional issues, and an in-depth knowledge of regions and cultures, which endows the School with a unique comparative advantage;<br><br>
- An interdisciplinary curriculum (undergraduate and graduate) delivered by an interdisciplinary faculty;<br><br>
- An emphasis on foreign language acquisition and on analytical skills such as statistics and econometrics;<br><br>


- The twin values of research and teaching excellence;<br><br>
- The positive impulses that emanate from a confident and capable tradition of faculty governance;<br><br>
- The cooperative relationship that has characterized relations between faculty and administration over the years. The breadth of SFS encourages innovation within and among strong and dynamic individual centers, programs and institutes. These units offer degrees and certificates as well as supporting research, and they are the basis for the proven ability of SFS to respond energetically and flexibly to the challenges and opportunities of a changing world. Programs, centers and institutes are listed in Appendix II.<br><br>
Relationship of SFS to Other Schools/Units at Georgetown<br><br>
SFS has extensive relationships with other Schools at Georgetown. Many SFS faculty have joint appointments in Georgetown College, where most arts and sciences departments are located. Among other advantages, this provides access for those faculty to Ph.D. students. There are dual MA/PhD programs with many College departments, as well as dual MA programs with the McDonough School of Business, the Law Center, and the new McCourt School of Public Policy.<br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">中国的前后左右之争</a><br><br>

Resources<br><br>
The annual budget of SFS is about $55 million. These funds come primarily from tuition, from the proceeds of various endowments (currently totaling about $171 million), and from gifts and grants.<br><br>
The dean will have a substantial fundraising responsibility. Working within the framework of the University’s current capital campaign (described below), and perhaps within an SFS centennial campaign as well, the dean will collaborate with excellent development staff to attract essential financial resources. Fundraising priorities are all directed toward creating the conditions for excellence and success of faculty and students. The dean will likely devote about 30 percent of his or her time to development activities.<br><br>
The Dean’s Responsibilities and Opportunities<br><br>
During this dynamic period for the University, the new SFS dean will participate in making critical decisions that will shape the School’s future. The dean will have the following primary responsibilities and leadership opportunities:<br><br>
- Leadership and vision: The new dean will have the opportunity to lead the School and to energize its community at this critical moment of reflection and celebration, working with the faculty to sustain the approaches that have made great success possible, to address existing and anticipated challenges, and to chart new goals that will take SFS confidently into its second century.<br><br>
- Continued support for collaboration: Collaboration across units of the University is fundamental to SFS, as described above. At the same time, faculty recognize that there are exciting opportunities both to deepen existing collaborations and to build new bridges to other units at Georgetown. For example, initiatives currently underway within SFS in areas like environmental policy and climate change, public health, and cyber-security could lead to promising collaboration across the University. The support of a new dean in realizing these possibilities will be essential.<br><br>
-Program enhancements: Enhancing educational programs, building on recent external program reviews and other assessments; addressing critical program issues, including for example the broader national debate about the continuing relevance of area studies from both an academic perspective and the perspective of graduates’ potential employers.<br><br>
- Engagement with the Qatar campus: Supporting engagement of SFS Washington faculty in the Qatar campus, and collaborating with other deans to facilitate the evolution of SFS-Qatar to a campus with a broader focus.<br><br>

Professional Qualifications and Personal Characteristics<br><br>
The ideal candidate will have many of the following professional qualifications and personal characteristics:
- University experience: An advanced degree and scholarly accomplishments that earn the respect of the academic community; substantial understanding of scholarly research across a wide range of fields; familiarity with and ability to work effectively in the culture of higher education, including the expectations of shared governance. As noted above, the dean’s appointment will reflect the nature of his or her academic experience. - Experience as a practitioner in international affairs: Significant stature and recognition as a leader in global issues; extensive and high-level experience in the international policy arena (either in the public sector, in business, or in the NGO world), with the ability to draw upon that experience to build the engagement of SFS students and faculty beyond the campus.<br><br>
- Management experience: Substantial relevant experience in the management of complex organizations to manage budgets; select, support, develop, and supervise/direct staff and related personnel; and form effective partnerships with faculty and administrators across the University. - Commitment to quality: A record of recruiting and developing both people and programs of the highest quality.<br><br>
- Strategic vision: The ability to engage others in deliberation about the future of SFS; the capacity to bring people together across disciplines and programs in pursuit of continuing growth and improvement.<br><br>
- Engagement with students: Eagerness to engage with students and to promote their academic and professional development. - Fund raising: Ability to provide stewardship for philanthropic contributions by building strong relationships of mutual trust and respect with existing donors, including partnership with the Board of Visitors; eagerness to build resources by engaging new donors.<br><br>
- Collaborative abilities: Ability to work effectively across all of Georgetown’s academic units, and externally as well, to forge new partnerships. - Personal qualities: Commitment to Georgetown’s values, strong interpersonal skills and inclination to teamwork; an inclusive approach to individuals and organizations.<br><br>
